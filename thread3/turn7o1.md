She snuggled into the bed as she felt herself relax in the first time since…   
~~Hands thrashed and legs kicked as they dragged her from her happy home into the abyss of their creation.~~   
For a long time. She didn't think she would ever get over Hell, but here in the very heart of Neuroi controlled area, she felt safe. And though the Neuroi still didn’t know much about humans, they did their best, and that was already more than she could have ever wished for.

Still, the Neuroi still had the occasional problem when dealing with humanity (thoughts of the Neuroi trying to figure out cooking briefly passed her thoughts). And many people that came from hell were barely clinging on, even with the vast technology that the Neuroi seemed to possess but more people were improving every day.

Then the Neuroi came to them with a proposal. Though the Neuroi believed they would be able to save their lives, many of them would be forever crippled by the horrors inflicted on them in Hell and would have many difficulties in life because it. Therefore, to aid them, they told them of a procedure that they might be able to undergo that would fix them of all their ailments. Grafting Neuroi technology onto them, the person would be cured though they would no longer be fully human anymore. It was a big thing, which was why the Neuroi would only do it for people who agreed before leaving them to their thoughts. She didn’t know what to think of the proposal. Though a part of her trusted the Neuroi, their saviors, another part of her instantly rebelled and trembled at being willingly experimented on once again.   
~~Knives that cut too deep, drugs that destroyed, pain, Pain, PAIN!~~   
She shivered a bit before her hand wandered up to her face, tracing an outline around her right eye. She wanted to trust them, wanted to believe her trust wouldn't be betrayed so badly it hurt. That everything would finally be alright.

The thought kept her up throughout the night...

Berlin was confused as he set to work once again. While most of his attention was focused on important things like his research or managing his territory, a small part of him was in charge of prisoner maintenance. And now he was about to once again undertake one of the more befuddling requirements in taking care of his prisoners. He understood the reason for cooking, breaking down difficult to eat materials into easier to use forms was natural after all. But the concept of taste was a bit complicated. What was perfectly healthy for humans based on his biological research didn't appear to appeal to the humans in his care at all and even seemed to make them worse if they were fed it for long periods of time.

To fix this problem, not only did he have to get the molecular combination right. But every human wanted subtly different molecular configurations! It could be pretty frustrating developing the correct carbon chain for each prisoner that appealed to them, which he would then have to make aesthetically pleasing to the person in question. Still, once he got the combination right. He could just replicate them at his leisure so it wasn't quite so bad.

As he was planning to move one carbon 10 microns to the left for his newest creation that would be given to witch #37. He was alerted of a witch trying to get his attention. Switching mental tracks, he found that it was one of the witches VV had sent him from the Zhong Guo's 731 facility. Paying more attention to the situation, what she asked of him was pretty surprising even as he was already setting up a room for her request.

He didn't actually think anyone would actually go for it. But now he had some work to do.

As she stared at her savior with her remaining eye. Haan Ara took a deep breath and said the words that felt like it would change everything.

"I want to go through with the operation."
