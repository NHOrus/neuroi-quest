#Turn 7, July 1946: Neuroi News!

###Empire-wide news.

- **SuperNova!:** A star in Imperial territory is expected to go supernova soon. Tourists from across the empire are arriving to watch the spectacle from a safe distance.

- **Corpse Looters:** The `206`/`302` War has attracted all sorts of unsavory types. Groups of scavengers are taking weapons, ships, and supplies from old battlefields and selling them to unknown parties. The Empire has set a bounty for each scavenger caught.

###Human Intelligence:

- **Fall of the Balkans:** The Berlin Neuroi have advanced through the Balkans with minimal resistance. The nations of the Balkans, lacking the military strength to actually fight the Neuroi, have surrendered. Orussia has diverted several crack divisions from the East to its Western border, fearing a major invasion.

- **Escalation in the Pacific:** The Fusoan Empire has escalated things across the Pacific. Large Imperial Fusoan Army units have landed across Zhong Guo, assisting the flagging Nationalist forces against the Communists. These new arrivals seems to have bolstered the Communist ranks, as more men and women rally to fight off what they see as an invading army. Fuso has also deployed several ships to resource-rich territories in the South Pacific. The Liberion Pacific Fleet, along with the navies of several minor nations has moved to counter these actions. Many fear that a war between humans will break out, even as the Neuroi continue to advance.

- **Defeat in Siberia:** With reinforcements from the Berlin Hive, the Vladivastok Neuroi have gained ground and continue to push north. Imperial Fusoan Army units have arrived to bolster the Orussian mlitary forces, and it is believed the presence of these units is why Orussia has yet to condemn Fuso's Unit 731.

- **A Second Dunkirk in the Mediterranean:** The Romagnan and Ottoman Fleets have successfully evacuated the remainder of the Afrika Korps from Libya. This success was further bolstered by a breakout through the Strait of Gibraltar. While several cruisers and destroyers were lost, most of the fleet has arrived in Britannia intact, and is undergoing refits. However, the Neuroi Submarines continue to maintain a strong presence near Gibraltar, continuing to intercept convoys of desperately needed supplies heading to Britannia.
