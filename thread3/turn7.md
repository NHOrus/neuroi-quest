Proposed Actions:
- Do Not Pass Gibralter, Do Not Collect 200 AE Units: Human Admiral Bergamini has become a major pain in your rear. Now, with the Meditteranean as good as taken, the Allies are trying to recall him and his entire fleet back for future battles. It would be best if he, along with his fleet and the Afrika Korps he is transporting, vanished along the way. Of course, this is going to be difficult. Looking through your previous encounters with him, and new discoveries about male human AE potential, he might very well be clairvoyant.
Reward: Romagnan and Ottoman Fleets destroyed, Afrika Korps destroyed, Rommel and Bergamini killed, satisfaction
-You don't have an Army, Borrow Mine: After their defeat in Romagna, the human Balkan nations are totally defenceless against you, other humans, or Cluster 302. It might be best to occupy them. You wouldn't even need a large contribution of forces to do so, considering you now have the capability to request surrender and negotiate terms.
Reward: Large Amounts of Territory and income gained. Balkans have reduced risk of 302 Landing.
-Attack! Attack! Attack!: With Romagna fully yours, you have new options of where to invade. Perhaps West Afrika? Or Baltland?
Reward: War Turn
-What do Alien Girls Like?: You owe Suez and VV for helping you out back in Romagna. Suez is just happy that you're giving him back that army, but what about VV? Maybe you could send her something in return. Like a ton of materials or reinforcements.(Would have to specify what to give her)
Reward: Very happy VV, Good feelings, VV gains ground on Earth
- 33 Minutes: You've pretty much annihilated the Witches in Europe. However, Gallia and Britannia might have a few good Squadrons they kept in reserve. Launching constant lightning raids across the border would totally exhaust the humans, leaving them vulnerable and unable to respond when you do attack.
Reward: Human Witches in Europe exhausted, vastly reduced combat effectiveness
-Make yourself at home: You find that you've suddenly got a glut of captive Witches. With this many, it might be best to make them comfortable so they don't feel that inclined to escape. Heavily secured, but comfortable.
Reward: Human captives more at ease, easier time experimenting, reduced chance of a breakout.
-Write in: ???

- I'm In Ur Base, Readin' Ur B00kz!: The Witches are finally out of your territory, it's time to ransack their old homes and bases and find out everything they know about Ambient Energy/Magic!
-Brain Invaders: Your Infiltrator Bugs are good for spying, but not much else, maybe you could modify them to take control of unsuspecting humans, giving them many more options.
-Don't Dig too Deep!: Tunnelling has proven itself to be effective before. Perhaps the creation of dedicated tunnellers would allow you to use such things more often.
-These are the Voyages Of-: If you're gonna establish a presence in space, you'll need more than satellites.
-Sequester: Surely there's a way to make your satellites a bit cheaper?
-Plasma Integration: You've got plasma on your biggest units, but that won't be enough against 302 PMCs. If you could jury-rig some platforms so your smaller units, or even just your Witches could use plasma, you'd be much better off.
-No System is Safe!: With another Cluster coming in, some upgrades to your Electronic Warfare capabilities couldn't go amiss.
-AE Adaptation: If at first you don't succeed...
-We Come in Peace!: An Emissary unit to negotiate with the humans sounds quite nice right about now.
-What we're paid for..: It's time to preform SCIENCE! on Yoshika Miyafuji! Non-invasively and harmlessly of course.
-Write in: You can research anything. ANYTHING. Including Magic.

Espionage Actions:
[]
-Scout: Choose a region or nation to do some reconnaissance on. You will gain information on their basic situation, troops numbers, and defences. (Costs 100 RU)
-Infiltrate: Deploy a massive amount of Bug Types to the region or nation. Will unlock more options as enhancements to infiltrators are made. (Costs 200 RU)
-Write in: Subject to GM Approval

Alliance Actions:
[]

-Attack: Choose a nation or region you would like your ally to attack. This can be to support your own forces, or just to open up another front. If they were already attacking, extra forces will be diverted to give them a better chance of winning.
-Research: Order one of your allies to research a given technology, they won't be as skilled, but every little bit counts.
-Construct: Ask an Ally to focus on a type of unit to build. Know that they will do this at the expense of other units, so be careful about using this.
-Write in: Subject to GM Approval
-Special Action: Some People Just Need Killing: Ask VV if she could spare some flyers and Sorceresses to raid the Unit 731 Compound in Zhong Guo. If successful, it will give the Neuroi very grateful former captives, extra information on human biology and Witch Magic, and other hidden benefits.
