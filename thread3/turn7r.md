Actions:
-Make yourself at home:
You manage to find the girls a nice old castle in Karlsland you're pretty sure was used by Witches before the whole war started. You even manage to get a great deal of furniture for it(The look on that Romagnan's face was priceless). It's spacious, heavily defended by Sorceresses and Turrets and other patrols. It's also now very comfortable, and your captives are beginning to act like regular people. They're still in a prison, but it's a fairly luxurious one.
Reward: Human captives more at ease, easier time experimenting, reduced chance of a breakout.

-What do Alien Girls Like?:
Reinforcements
30 Infantry bot divisions
10 Anti-Tank bot divisions
15 Walker groups
3 Ultra-Heavy Walker Groups
15 Small Flyers groups
5 Medium Flyer groups
2 Large Flyer groups
4 MkII Witch groups
2 Artillery groups


You stuff the forces into a series of Orbital shuttles, tune them up to make sure they get through, and send them on their way to a controlled crash landing near Vladivastok. A few units take some damage, but there are still enough to ensure that Vladivastok can use them. VV seems pretty happy now.
Reward: Very Happy VV-chan, Additional Alliance slot, Vladivastok Hive gains ground in Siberia


-You don't have an Army, Borrow Mine:
Your occupation of the Balkans doesn't even deserve to be called an invasion. The humans are demoralized after their defeat of Romagna, and what remains of the Ottomans forces in the Balkans have fled back to Istanbul. The entire region is yours, and with barely any casualties on your part. Though many humans were evacuated, there is still a sizeable population in areas like Greece and the Ottoman Territory, where the Neuroi were never able to obtain victory.
Reward: Captured Ostmark, Venezia, Moesia, Dacia, and all of Balkans, +29 Million Humans, +250 RU per turn from Population, +3,500 RU Per Turn from Territory

Research:
- I'm In Ur Base, Readin' Ur B00kz!: (100 RU)
The information you've gotten from the human Witch records is... disturbing. As far as you can tell, the humans have been using magic like this since before they even had cities. From Mesopotamia to Ancient Egypt, to Native Liberion tribes, to Samurai and Ninja in Fuso, Magic is one constant, and each culture has used it in a different form when it comes to combat. There are thousands of separate techniques and abilities in all of human history. There are also some basic fundamental theories about Magic, including familiars, spells, shields, etc. It's all very informative.
Reward: Increased Sorceress Combat Effectiveness, Bonus to combat effectiveness of Witch-based Hero Unit, Bonus to research of Witch-Based Hero Unit

-AE Adaptation: (500 RU)
This. Goes. Perfectly.
AE adaptation for your units may have reduced your income slightly, but the payoffs are massive. All of your Neuroi units now have weak AE generators, allowing them to
either enhance their weapons fire into devastating blasts, or generate weak magical shields. It's not as powerful as Witch shields, but it's certainly something, and is more than the 302 PMC will have.
Reward: All Neuroi Units equipped with Magical Generators, can use AE to generate (Weak) shields or enhance weapons, -200 RU per turn

-We Come in Peace!: (300 RU)
You think you have a unit that can finally communicate with the humans on their own terms. It looks like a human Witch, with a working mouth, eyes, ears, and face. It also has built in laser cannons for when negotiation becomes less of an option, along with the best Electronic equipment to eavesdrop on private conversation on other devices.
Reward: Emissary Class Neuroi, can now initiate Diplomacy with human factions

-What we're paid for..: It's time to preform SCIENCE! on Yoshika Miyafuji! Non-invasively and harmlessly of course. (600 RU)
Through constant study of Yoshika Miyafuji's body, a few harmless tests, and observing her as she heals the wounded, you think you know where she gets all her AE from.
The best way to say it is that she's... enriching the Ambient Energy. Drawing large amounts of it into the ground, and empowering it, before sending it back into the Earth. However, large amounts of this Enriched AE stay in her system, providing her with unparalleled power.
This has given you several ideas for how to enhance the Sorceress class of Neuroi.
Further studies into human biology have you believe it may be possible to create a Human/Neuroi Hybrid, using Yoshika Miyafuji's method of AE enriching to provide vast amounts of power. The result would be a warrior capable of facing off with the Imperial Military units and winning.
Reward: Human/Neuroi Hybrid Hero Unit Research Unlocked

Espionage Actions:
-Infiltrate: Zhong Guo (200 RU)
Your Bug-Types managed to infiltrate several cities and Resistance groups. While you have some units in the Communist and Nationalist camps, most of your Bugs have infiltrated the more independent groups who haven't chosen a side yet. There are would-be messiahs, bandit warlords, doomsday cults, even a bunch that are worshipping the Neuroi as gods. At the moment you've got little solid information, but from all appearances the Communists are winning the war against the Nationalists, and there are rumours that Fuso is preparing to deploy their army into Zhong Guo to support the Nationalists.
You've also got rumours that the Orussians are forcing Fuso to pay through the nose for materials that only they are willing to sell to the Fusoans after Unit 731. Not sure if they have any weight to them though.
At least you've got some infiltrators in the Units 731 base. What the Fusoans are doing there is... disgusting to say the least.

Alliance Actions:
-Special Action: Some People Just Need Killing:
--She can use the flyers and the Witch groups we send as part of the raid along with the intel from our espionage.
She didn't scream anymore when they came for her. She had at first, but after the first week of hell she'd realized that no one would ever come for her. She'd also given up killing herself. The doctors made sure she didn't have the strength for that. Besides, there was always another Witch nearby, to make sure they weren't deprived of a valuable test subject.


So she'd stayed silent for the past six months. Six months. The tests varied. At first they made her run, made her push her magic to its limit until she collapsed, used it in a number of ways. Then things had gotten worse when she'd weakened.


They'd put diseases in her. She'd seen it before, seen her friends, her sisters, her mother and father, all take sick with it, vomit up red, and eventually die. Not her though, oh no. She had magic, she could be useful. They took notes as her magic glowed and fought off the infection before failing. Then they'd take her to a room. Cut her up, take something from her. She didn't scream when the pain started. Pain was a constant companion. It kept her sane.


Then a Witch would heal her until she was a healthy girl again. Before she'd be infected with something new.
This time was different though. The walls were shaking, there was shouting, yelling, bright flashes, gunfire. The Witch burst in, her eyes cold, and she raised a pistol.


She wasn't scared. Death was a mercy she'd never gotten after all.
Then she stopped as a red flash tore through her chest.


A black figure stood in front of her. A Neuroi. She remembered. It picked her up easily. She saw sunlight. Sunlight, beautiful sunlight for the first time on her pale skin and emaciated body. There were many like her out there, and many Neuroi, being put gently into strange black vehicles and given bits of odd paste and water.
Then it hit her. They were rescuing her. She was free.


Her mother had always told her horror stories. How the Neuroi were evil monsters that wanted to hurt her.

She knew now that was impossible. How could something that had saved her from Hell ever have been a monster?

VV is pretty sure that she saw commandos from at least a half dozen other nations trying to get into the compound before she busted out all the prisoners. They're a sorry bunch, most infected with some kind of disease, missing organs, so skinny you can see the bones, but they're alive, and practically worshipping the Neuroi at this point.
The research is rather disturbing. It is a detailed description of how the human body conducts, generates, and uses Ambient Energy, along with several Biological Weapons test data.
The most disturbing thing however, is one way they were planning on using it.
The Magic Virus, or Ambient Energy Virus. It can best be described as a magical nanobot virus, sending hordes of little AE bots to break down targets of a certain type molecule by molecule. A horrible, agonizing way to die. It could easily be used on humans, and studies report that they have used prototype versions on a few human settlements with "satisfactory results".
However, looking over the data, there is nothing stopping it from being re-purposed to be used on the Neuroi.
Rewards: Karma, Lots of grateful human captives, including several dozen Witches, Bonus to Human/Neuroi Hybrid, Data on Ambient Energy Virus.
