#BURN CAPTURE the Witch!

*I think it’s a Witch.*

*You think all young female Humans are Witches.*

The two Infantry Bots were assigned to guard the small AE collector positioned on the edge of this small Human settlement. The area was avoided by the locals for the most part, but it was still close enough to receive a 3% increase in AE draw.

*Well it’s not a Soldier. Only a Witch would break the soft cordon the Humans have established around the collector.*

`IBS-R-SC136-01` zoomed in it’s view of the target of their discussion. It was a very young specimen of the dominant local species. Cross-referencing showed it was not as developed as even the youngest documented combat Witch. `IBS-R-SC136-02` was just paranoid from going over combat loges to much.

`SC136-01` noted the simulacrum in the target's manipulators appeared to have Striker units on its legs.

01 accessed the collectors loges. *AE levels have not increased since it approached.*

*You don’t know how to read those!* `02` countered.

*The occurrence of Witches among the Female population is low enough that it is statistically unlikely.* `01` changed tracks as it, in fact, did not know how to read the AE collectors loges.

*Dice say it’s a Witch.*

`01` transmitted the equivalent of a sigh. *That's not how the Religion works. And I’ve seen the algorithm you use for that App. It is not a random number generator, it’s a High Or Low number generator.*

A moment of silence stretched on the local network.

*Human Bullshit says it’s a Witch.*

Again, a moment of silence.

*The Boss has be collecting Witches.* 01 finally transmitted, shifting it’s optic slightly to bring it’s counterpart into view.

*I bet if we catch one, we could get promoted.* 02 transmitted with an attached file code for excitement. *Maybe get us some Heavy chassis! Or, or maybe even a Land Battleship! I heard that with all the new land we can easily afford those now.*

`IBS-R-SC136-01` did like the sound of that. It hadn’t been a Infantry Bot for very long, but it already knew being one sucked.

*We’ll get deleted if we damage it though. We aren't exactly equipped to do ‘non-lethal’.*

Some of 02’s enthusiasm drained as that was pointed out. *That’s true.*

Focusing back on the Target, `01` transmitted *It’s probably not a Witch anyway.*

*”Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.”* `02` quoted. *It’s definitely a Witch.*

*If anything can go wrong, then 302 is about to land a Hive on top of us after sneaking in system with Fold Subspace Drive.*

After `02` didn’t reply `01` checked the local network traffic, and indeed, `02` was looking up Fold Subspace Drives in the database. It transmitted another sigh.

*That’s not how those work.*

*No. It’s not.*

Any further decision was halted as the Target suddenly began approaching.

Nervous, `02` asked *Uh, what should we do?*

*As long as it doesn't try damaging the collector, we aren't supposed to do anything.*

And so the Bots watched, as still as they had been throughout their conversation. Only their optics moving to track her as the little girl walked right up to them, Witch doll clutched to her chest.

She then proceeded to kick `IBS-R-SC136-02` in the shin, before turning around and running off.

The two watched as another Female, presumably the child's Mother unit, ran out to collect her, and returning to the settlement as quickly as possible.

A minute passed before `02` sent with a file code of smugness, *I totally just survived being attacked by a Witch.*

`IBS-R-SC136-01` transmitted a sigh.
