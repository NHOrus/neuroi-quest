# Neuroi Quest

<img alt="Quest Logo" src="./images/logo.png">

Once, upon a time, world was sane and normal. You, young Neuroi graduate student, in an attempt to supply yourself with enough money to continue your education, signed up with your Hive Cluster for a mining expedition into remote reaches of a Galaxy.

Sadly, your immediate superior ended up very incompetent and dead, natives of this backwater planet ended up more powerful than expected advancing exceedingly fast and entire mining expedition shrunk from a hundred Hives down to four. On the plus side, now no one can enforce laws of Neuroi Empire too much and kick you in the head when you appears to be looking more competent than Superhive.
