# Neuroi Quest

![Quest logo](./images/logo.png)

Once, upon a time, the world was sane and normal. You, a young Neuroi graduate student, in an attempt to supply yourself with enough resources to continue your education, signed up with your Hive Cluster for a mining expedition into remote reaches of the Galaxy.

Sadly, your immediate superior was very incompetent and ended up very dead and natives of this backwater planet ended up more powerful than expected. Entire mining expedition shrunk from a hundred Hives down to four. On the plus side, now no one can enforce the laws of the Neuroi Empire too much and kick you in the core when you appears to be looking more competent than the Superhive.
