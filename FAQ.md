# Frequently Asked Questions
#### By Jwolfe and NHO

**Q:** What are Fahrong?  
**A:** The Fahrong Conglomerate is a species of sentient Golems.

**Q:** What is Mark 1 Neuroi Witch?  
**A:** A Neuroi in humanoid form with anti-witch tactics implanted into it.  
It's got very limited Ambient Energy abilities, little more than basic shield and pre-cog.  
It's reliable, since it's not sentient and lacks a Soul, but not exactly all powerful. 

**Q:** If a sentient neuroi's body consists of an entire hive, how the hell do we reproduce?  
**A:** Some questions were not meant to be answered.

**Q:** Is war amongst the Hive Clusters truly so common?  
**A:** Not very common, but it does happen occasionally.  
With the history between `206` and `302`, most people are just surprised it didn't happen sooner.

**Q:** How do we ship Ambient Energy to our superiors&
**A:** You get your Quota filled via beaming it back home. Works on AE just fine, but your transporters don't have the power to do it to anything physical.  
They tend to explode when you try.
 
**Q:** Can we drop neurotoxin or other biological/chemical weapon on Humans or hostile Neuroi?  
**A:** *Under Protocol `H-4972-C,` usage of biological Weapons of Mass Destruction is prohibited without express permission from the Home world. Citizen, for this violation, report to the nearest re-education center.*   
More seriously,Neuroi don't have that many bioweapons, and they're under very strict watch by the higher-ups. 

**Q:** People keep talking about a tvtropes page, where is it?  
**A:** [Neuroi Quest](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/NeuroiQuest)

**Q:** What about (insert-Striker-Witch-name-here)? Is she all right?  
**A:** `10 to 1` she's dead. Neuroi tech advances have meant Striker-capable Witches got picked off pretty fast in the last year (along with the later suicides, mental breakdowns etc:(). Between the 40 some POWs and the 100 strong 1st augmented, the Neuroi have 80-90% of of remaining Striker classed Witches in Europe, Asia and potential Afrika.

- **Q:** Why can't our satellites shoot things on the ground from orbit?
- **A:** They aren't designed for it.  
  - **Q:** Well lets make them that way.
  - **A:** Neuroi Imperial Law does not allow non military hives to posses orbit to ground weaponry (which you are). Punishment involves atomizing the offending hive(s) via a top of the line military group.
    - **Q:** So we won't tell anyone, why not make them?
    - **A:** A PMC from a rival Hive is arriving in less then a year. The GM has previously said there would be spies on board. At least some of these would be from the government making sure 206 and 302 don't break too many laws in their turf war. They would report the violation back home resulting in us and the planet getting atomized.
    

- **Q:** Why can't we have XYZ super weapon?
- **A:** Neuroi civilian hives (such as us) are normally only given access to laser technology for weapons. We got permission to use plasma weapons on turn 5. Fortunately the PMC coming is not allowed any weapons stronger then that, nor are they allowed to do any orbital bombardment.

- **Q:** An allied Hive just came up with this cool tech. Why aren't they sharing it?
- **A:** The tech exchange system between the Hives works as follows. A Hive invents a piece of tech on Turn 1 and can use it immediately. At the beginning of turn 2 all the other Hives receive the designs.

- **Q:** Why are we looking at silly AE/magic tech instead of cool Grav-cannons, rail-guns etc?
- **A:** Most if not all of the stuff you want are low grade military gear at best for Neuroi. Military weapon technology is at the point that planets are considered fragile if they don't have the proper shielding systems added. The AE based technology and weapons that we are pursuing is something completely new for the greater galaxy.

- **Q:** Why don't we make XYZ weapon from (video game/TV/book etc) series? It would be cool and kill everything!
- **A:** The Neuroi Empire came up with an equivalent to that a while ago/isn't possible in this universe. If it does exist, it's PMC grade at worst, low-tier military at best.  
If it isn't in said category, we don't have the infrastructure to make it or the knowledge to design it. Our Hive is the equivalent of a civilian scientist graduate student. He does not have access to military-grade knowledge and has no idea as how to make the tools to make the tools to make the weapon.

- **Q:** Why aren't we going to the moon or something? We can mine RU all we want there and the humans can't attack us.
- **A:** The Neuroi did away with needing to collect materials a long time ago. Their matter replicators make the ones in Star Trek look like a has-been. RU is based off of our Ambient Energy (AE) collection. This energy (known to the humans as magic) is produced by biological organisms and is the main power source for the Neuroi and the Fahrong. It cannot be harvested in useful amounts from a dead world. 

- **Q:** How happens there is no USSR in Neuroi Quest?
- **A:** Strike Witches timeline changes *way* before any of that.  
Orussia's army, supported by large amounts of Night Witches, actually kicked major amounts of ass in the Crimean War.  
Likewise in the first Neuroi War, and there never was a Fuso-Orussia war.  
The world is *very* different. Orussia's army under the Tsar has a reputation as being one of the most well trained and professional forces on the planet, second only to Karlsland. It's Night Witches the most feared Witches group on the planet. 
In Crimean War Orussia had Night Witches. Which meant Orussia had the equivalent of modern radar/super-magical sensors and Night Vision for the whole war.
The Orussians literally knew where their enemies were, how many of them were there, what their situation was, and where they maneuver to gain the advantage, virtually 100% of the time.
Orussia won the Crimean War and was industrializing quite a bit earlier. A lot of the Balkan nations were Orussian puppets in all but name.

- **Q:** How much of our history happened in the world of Neuroi Quest?
- **A:** Strike Witches timeline changes with Caesar avoiding getting assassinated and being named Augustus.  
You know, Caesar of Ancient Rome.  
Oh, and Lord Nobunaga of Japan also lived and expanded Japan beyond its home islands into the rest of the Pacific.
