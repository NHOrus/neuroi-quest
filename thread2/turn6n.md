#Turn 6, June 1946: Neuroi News!

###Empire-wide news.

- **Fahrong Discontent?:** Reports on the border show several Fahrong fleets having standoffs with each other on several key border worlds. While the cause is unknown, many in the Empire urge the military to take advantage of this weakness and opportunity.

- **Price of a Mile:** The War between Clusters 206 and 302 continues, with neither side gaining or losing ground. Planets change hands dozens of times each day, each time costing both sides countless lives. Several minor Clusters have thrown their support behind one of the two combatants, contributing to the ever-rising body count.

###Human Intelligence:

- **Crushing Defeat at Romagna:** Romagna has fallen, and in an utterly demoralizing way as well. Though initially the defenders fought fanatically, a Neuroi device annihilated the city of Taranto and everyone in it, while another has wiped out the Greek and Venezian fleets. Even worse, half of the legendary 501st JFW has been captured by the Neuroi.

- **Slaughter in Afrika:** The Afrikan Neuroi have struck again, and inflicted another defeat upon humanity. Using strange, new, powerful weaponry, the Neuroi have annihilated the Britannians in the Sinai Peninsula and forced the Afrika Korps to retreat further west.

- **Retreat in Siberia:** The Neuroi in Vladivastok have continued their advance across Eastern Siberia. The Orussian military has been hard-pressed to stop them, and, oddly enough, the Neuroi seem mostly fixated on clearing a path to the north.

- **SUBS!?:** Contrary to previous beliefs, the Neuroi have demonstrated that they do indeed have a navy. One made out of submarines at that. Though this fleet was defeated at the Fall of Romagna, the continued attacks on Allied Convoys in the Atlantic show that they are still a presence, slowly choking Europe to death.

- **Baffling Neuroi Behavior:** In Siberia, Afrika, and Romagna, the Neuroi have been behaving oddly. Rather than exterminating any humans they come across like before, they are instead demanding surrender, and allowing civilians to continue to live their lives in captured territories and cities. The exact number is unknown, but there are at least tens of millions living this way, much to the utter bafflement of humans worldwide.

- **War Crimes in Zhong Guo:** A horrific, and ugly truth about the Zhong Guo Civil War has been revealed. Communist Forces in Manchuria have uncovered and revealed a series of Imperial Fusoan Army experiments conducted in Harbin. This group, called `Unit 731` was conducted horrific human-experiments upon the people of Zhong Guo, particularly on Witches. Live experimentation on Witches, including vivisection and forcefully infecting them with diseases has occurred with the purpose of study on both biological weapons and possible countermeasures, as well as exploitation of the abilities of Magic. This research increased in intensity with the discovery of Male Magic, and thousands more were taken in, some not even in their teens. Over 10,000 are believed to have died due to the activities of Unit 731.  
Even more horrible, evidence shows that the Nationalists knew that these experiments were occurring, but allowed, and in some cases assisted in it in exchange for support and attacks on Communist forces. In the wake of this, the nations of Britannia, Liberion, Gallia, and Karlsland have severed all diplomatic relations with the Fusoan Empire, and Communist camps are swelling with new recruits.
