Hail to your new, hopefully not destroyed in their first battle, Neuroi Artillery.
You can dream dammit!

### Actions:
- **The Best Defence...:** You probably have the humans off balance from the fall of Venice. If you capitalize on their surprise, you might be able to for them out of Romagna entirely.  
*Reward:* Battle of Romagna begins this turn. Humans would be unprepared and not fully reinforced.  
Your invasion has caught the humans completely off guard. Your forces are strafing their reinforcements while they're still landing, and many depots and bases lie in ruins before they can even respond. Overall, you've caused massive damage.  
Best not to get too cocky though. You've still got a few million armed and very pissed off Romagnan militia wanting to have a couple words with you.  
**Rewards:** Severe damage dealt to human forces in Romagna. War Turn begins next post.  

- **Girls' Day In (a giant `Alien Stronghold`):** You've studied the biology of the humans sufficiently, but you're still not sure how they interact. Come to think of it, your captive Witches have started to become rather unstable, and have been noted to be walking around in the exact same patterns, dropping small objects on the floor repeatedly, and in some cases, going into fetal positions on the floor. Perhaps you could let them interact with each other, while under very, VERY, heavy guard?  
You have your Neuroi Witches (Or Sorceresses, as the humans call them) bring the five human witches you have as captives into a large room, under ridiculous guard of course. The reactions vary, but they seem mostly positive. Squadron-mates are reunited with large amounts of hugs, tears, and babbling about how much they missed each other. And none went crazy or screamed bloody murder! It's all quite fascinating, and you get a strange feeling inside of you.  
You continue hosting these reunions every day. The Witches seem to like them. You've even got their names.  
`Sarah Lebs`, `Cecilia Harris`, `Matsuda Shouko`, `Delia Jeram`, and `Ottilie Kittel`.  
**Rewards:** Mental stability of captive Witches increased, data on human social functions, bonus to non-horrific death-dealing interactions with humans.

- **We're all alien invaders here.:** Despite having fought with them for some time, you have to admit, you don't know your comrades very well. Perhaps you should try to fix that.  
Your meetings with the other Hives give you a much better idea of who your working with. The old boss never wanted you to socialize with the others, for reasons of not wanting any subordinates to get too powerful. Fortunately, he's not likely to complain now.

First is the `Vladivastok` Hive. The girl seems to have ambitions to be a constructions overseer, making Mega-structures and Dyson spheres, but for now, she's stuck on Earth with the rest of you. A quick tour of her Hive and the surrounding area displays she's turned the entire area in not just a fortress, but a work of art, with several bizarre yet fascinating structures with strange angles, curves, and shapes that amaze the eye. It's quite fascinating really.  
_"Nevergottosaythankyoubeforebackatthestartofthecycle'causeIthoughtIwasagonerbeforeyougavemethenewlasersandhelpedcallofthehumanssocallmeifyoueverneedsomethingbuiltokayI'llbehappytohelpinanywayIcan!!!"_
She's also more energetic than a sun. You can't help but like her.  

The `Atlantic Hive`, well, the new `Atlantic Hive Manager` greets you quite happily. The old boss was a corrupt idiot with more connections than brains, so the Supervisor sent him to the bottom of the ocean where he couldn't get the resources to fuck everything up. He tended to take it all out on the Neuroi who weren't as high ranking.  
"Sad to say, he was a bit careless, kept his software a bit too close to the outer hull, you know?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Well, uh, turns out one day, we were all coming back from a raid on a human convoy, when suddenly, and totally out of the void to, the torpedoes start loosing, and before we can do anything, they smash right into him, and Poof! Down he goes! Quite a tragedy really."  
"I'm sure."  
"Anyway, just thought you should know, we've got a fleet of Submersibles headed your way. You can mark off the whole Romagnan fleet in any fights there, and we'll keep the straight of Gibraltar, as the humans call it, nice and tight."

You can tell `Suez` was once a soldier, if the message about Vasaii wasn't enough. He's got the gaze, experience, and the weariness in his voice. Though he seems to have taken a liking to you for some reason. He doesn't speak much, but when you bring up the coming battle in Romagna, he gives you several tips on how to improve the way your forces fight in battle, and promises to send in his own forces to hit them from the south, provided Atlantic can secure the crossing.  
He apparently knows about what you've been doing to the human refugees in Romagna. "It's good to see that I'm not alone in what to do with the humans. I've seen enough pointless death."

All in all, a series of quite productive meetings.

**Reward:** Relations with all Hives Greatly Improved, Straight of Gibraltar blockaded by Atlantic Hive, Alliance Action Slot gained starting next turn.

###Research Actions:
- **To go boldly where pretty much every other Neuroi has gone before!:** Viable space craft just moved waaaay up on your priority list. (`600` RU)  
It's not pretty, it's not elegant, it's definitely not cheap, but you've got space-lift capability and satellites. Not enough to stop a full-scale assault by a PMC, but it's something at least.  
**Reward:** New Unit Unlocked: Multi-laser Orbital Satellite Battery (Costs `300` RU per Battery) (`6` per Battery) (Excellent vs Strike Craft, Weak vs larger ships)

- **Maus Trap:** Figure out what you can about these Super-Heavy Tanks, they nearly cost you the battle of Berlin. (`500` RU)  
**Good news:** You know how these human tanks were so powerful.  
**Bad News:** It's terrifying.  
The idea behind the Magic-Generator on the Maus is simple. It uses magic from a Witch or two to power shields, increase speed, make the gun more powerful, and basically make the thing perform better than it normal would. That's fine.  
This next part? Not so much.  
The Generator doesn't just draw AE from the Witches, it takes it from the output of the humans that crew the tank. This alone vastly increases to power of the tank, but it gets worse. The technology can be miniaturized. Though the humans haven't figured out how to do it yet, if time goes on they might find a way to use this to enhance every ship, tank, and air-plane in their arsenal.  
Or gods forbid: Every individual soldier.  
**Reward:** `Oh Crap Moment`, Bonus to AE research

- **Potemkin village:** You got a whole bunch of human refugees loitering around in your territory and their supplies are running out. Considering that you can't move them all right now and just killing them all is distasteful, set up supply drops for essentials so that they can survive for now. As part of it observe what the humans consider normal habitation conditions as you apparently missed something with the captive witches. (`400` RU)  
This succeeds beyond your wildest dreams. There are over 15 million refugees trapped behind your lines, most of them starving and exposed, and all of them are terrified. Most of them panic at the first sight of your Neuroi and try to hide the younger members of their species, then stare baffled as crates loaded with various materials, food, and water are lowered to them. Most of the food was actually looted or copied off of human food you've acquired. After a couple hours of baffled staring at it all, a few of the braver ones sample what you've given them.  
Reassured it's not poisonous, the remainder start to dig in happily. Now that they're starting to believe you're not about to kill them all, some are beginning to resettle a few of the abandoned cities deep inside your lines. Milan is becoming home to thousands, and more are arriving every day as the supply drops continue. To your pleasant surprise, you notice they are already saturating the area with Ambient Energy, increasing your mining output. They're still edgy when your units pass by, but they're not shooting on sight with their inefficient scavenged and improvised weaponry.  
Observations of their behaviour mean that you now have a somewhat good idea of how humans work in society. Not exactly very detailed, but enough that you can tell what the average human is doing.  
**Rewards:** Now informed about human society, 15 million human "Protectorate", +`100` RU per turn

- **AE Adaptation:** Your conventional units could do with some upgrading. Perhaps the best option would be to modify them with AE. You could boost their capabilities by a great deal, especially with your new discoveries on AE. (`500` RU)  
This is quite a bit tougher than you thought it would be. You've made some headway, but it's still a challenge, and will require more work before you get any returns.  
**Rewards:** Bonus to next AE-based upgrade roll
