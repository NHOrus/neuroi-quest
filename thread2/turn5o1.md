#Neuroi pants

~Schrkk~ ~Crackle Crackle~

Blinking in confusion at the unexpected interference to her favorite TV show, Sergeant Alicia Alcott furrowed her brow as she got up to try and see what was wrong. There was no way it could be broken already could it? They just got the damn thing.

As she fiddled with the antennae a bit, the static abruptly cut out. Looking down at the TV, she noticed what looked like the beginning of a commercial. Eyes widening, she couldn't help but groan in disappointment. Don't tell her she missed it!? They were getting to the best part!

Sulking, she was just about to switch the channel when she saw what was on the screen.

"*What?*"

Because on the screen was what looked to be a Neuroi, one of the witch variants judging by the shape, standing in front of a camera.

And then it began talking.

**"Hello ladies. Look at yourself, now back to me, now back at yourself, now back to me.​  
Sadly, You're not me. But if you stopped using inferiorly designed Striker Units, you could fight like me.​**

Alicia couldn't help but bristle at the insinuation, but something kept her watching the unusually strange but catchy commercial.

**Look down, back up. Where are you? You're in space, with the Neuroi your Witches could fight like.​  
What's in your hand, back to me. I have it, It's a Witch, with pants you could wear.​**

​
At that, you couldn't help but gasp, with the sound echoing for some reason, as a witch appeared from somewhere off-stage. Pants. How devious! A witch couldn't use a striker with pants, so they were effectively grounded unless they took them off. And that would take up precious time in which the witch would probably be caught again anyway. On the other hand, the witch in question did seem appreciative of not having to walk around in her underwear all the time though. ~~Which you were slightly jealous of.​~~

​
**Look again, The pants are now a Neuroi built Striker Unit.​**

​
At **That,** you couldn't help but gape as the red haired Witch's pants shined before she was covered in a white body suit with a scarf appearing around her neck to complete the ensemble. Before she lifted off the ground and began hovering in mid air. And it looked Amazing. You wonder where the propulsion was, but then you noticed little protrusions near the legs. Were those...!​
​
**Anything is possible if you can wear pants and follow the Neuroi.​
I'm on a Landship.​**

​
And with that, the TV switched back to the program she was watching. Seeming as if no time had passed at all.​  
Blinking, from the ~~worthwhile~~ strange commercial with the ~~amazing~~ useless product placement you noticed a number of witches were surrounding you.​  
As all the witches were trying to figure out what to do, one voice broke the silence.​
​
"*I've got to get me some of those.*"​
