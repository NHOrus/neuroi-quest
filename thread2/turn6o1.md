*Beep*

In the first couple of seconds, I hear nothing.

"Hello?" I call into the intercom. "Is anyone there?"

A rasping sound, barely distinguishable from the static (however little of that the Neuroi tech introduces), comes through the speaker. Breathing?

"Hello? Please say something!" I glance at the numbers ticking down near the intercom. "I don't have much time, please respond."

"G'way..."

"What was that? I can't hear—"

"Go away!" a girl shrieks, then dissolves into a coughing fit. Her voice is very coarse, as if her throat was sore.

"Um... What is your na—"

"I said go away! Shut up! Shut up! Shut uuuuup!"

That doesn't sound normal at all.

"... Are you alright?"

"What do you think?! You took my soul away, and now you're asking if I'm alright?!"

Another coughing fit follows that outburst, and then I have to strain to parse the faint murmuring:

"... Don't listen to it, Maria, the machine doesn't care, the machine doesn't feel... That's why it took your soul, so it could feel, isn't it?.. The machine speaks now, wants something else from you... Well, we're not going to give in, now are we? You're a good girl, Maria, you're a strong girl, you can still kill the enemy without a soul, can't you? You still have your arms and legs and teeth. Yes, yes, your sharp, beautiful teeth..."

What is she talking about? Is she crazy? *What did the Neuroi do to her?!*

"Listen, you've got to pull yourself together, alright?" It sounds like she thinks that I'm a Neuroi, I should probably fix that. "I'm a Witch, just like you, Maria, right? The Neuroi allow me to talk—"

"Yeah, yeah," the girl drawls, "Maria's not listening, but even if she was, she's not going to fall for that. You took her soul, gods damned machine, not her mind! I'll never betray my country! I'll never help you kill my friends! Do you hear me?! Never!"

Some shuffling can be heard, then a loud thud, and then the communicator beeps to signal a closed connection.
