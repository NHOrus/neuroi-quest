#Troubled Tidings

###By jwolfe

####After action report: `July 19th 1946`

At `0521` hours the` 501st Joint Fighter Wing`, and and the attached forces came under attack by a combined arms force of Neuroi units. Ten Neuroi Sorceresses[^1] and accompanying Small type Flyers secured the Striker hanger while four Hwacha Class Neuroi on submersible transports destroyed all AA defenses, armories and communication facilities.  

At this point, as Commander Wilcke, Major Sakamoto and Lieutenants Yeager and Barkhorn were preparing to fight their way to the Strikers, the Flyers deposited a large container beside the Sorceresses, one of which opened a dialog with the Witches present.[^2]  


**Transcript of Dialog Follows:**

---
*Neuroi Sorceress:* Cease your advance. No further conflict will occur at this present time unless you begin it.

*Lt. Barkhorn* : Wha-Why the **** should we believe a word you say say, you murdering freaks!

*Cdr. Wilcke:* Stand down Lieutenant. (to Neuroi units) If you aren’t here to kill us why are you here?

*Neuroi Sorceress:* Returning non combat worthy individuals that can no longer provide research information and have become resource and attention sinks.  
(At this point the container stared dissolving and three of the Sorceresses carry out individuals recognizable as witches Rall, Krupinski, Pokryshkin and several others from the Berlin assault force[^3]. All individuals while not emaciated do not appear in particularly good health with haggard features and long unkempt hair. The witches are placed at a midpoint between the two groups where Sakamoto, Yeager and Barkhorn move to give aid.)

*Lt. Yeager:* What the ****** hell have you done to our sisters?

*Neuroi Sorceress:* Final command from Director at main complex to Civilian Junior/Research Hive SBDK-2101 or as you call me, Berlin: Determine the process by which subject Yoshika Miyafuji regained her ability to generate and manipulate ambient energy after seemingly permanent burnout. While I was capable of replicating the burnout aspect of the event, none managed to regain their abilities.

*Maj. Sakamoto:* Then why would you give them back, Berlin is it?

*Neuroi Sorceress:* Correct Major. I have far more important and pressing matters to deal with. Namely insuring the survival of myself and my colleagues from a far more dangerous threat then humans. Though you will possibly be grateful to hear, this will also most likely involve the survival of this planet.

At this point the Neuroi units present fired into the Striker hanger presumably to prevent quick pursuit and departed with no further attacks. All recovered witches were, as stated by the Neuroi , incapable of using magic but should otherwise make full physical recoveries given time and therapy. Of the captives Lt. XXXXXXX apparently spoke to the Neuroi prior to release regarding the events mentioned by the Sorceress before departure. (See Appendix 022 for conversation)

[^1]While the humanoid units deployed from the Berlin and now other Hives do have similar abilities to Witches referring to the former as the later was not well received by the members of the Joint Fighter Wings (Name those things something different, they aren’t us, all they are is sick copies! – *Maj. Sakamoto*)   
[^2]No, none of my girls was drinking and neither was I. Though I’m going start to as soon as this insane FUBAR gets settled. *Cdr. Wilcke*   
[^3]See Appendix 001 for complete recovery list.
