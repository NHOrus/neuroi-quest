“I’m afraid the report is accurate General. We have effectively lost the entire Mediterranean and the majority of our forces in the area to the Neuroi, including all the Witches we sent into the area."

“All of them?”

“Any witch that didn’t die in the superbomb blasts were forced to surrender for the lives of the remaining soldiers and civilians. Including half of the 501st JFW. We’ve lost contact with the rest, presumably MIA and out of contact due to the superbombs. Hopefully they got away, but we don't know anything more at this time."

“The Neuroi actually called for them to surrender?”

“Yes sir. Intelligence is still trying to determine the significance of the Neuroi’s sudden shift to negotiation instead of extermination, but it is confirmed by surviving units and radio transmissions that the Neuroi called for the surrender of arms and the Witches. They also transmitted images to nearby television stations that match five Witches that were presumed KIA or MIA after the battle of Karlsland, which probably means they want to take Witches alive for some reason now. But-”

“Intelligence doesn’t know what the hell they will do to those poor girls.” Finished Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies. An army that was rapidly dwindling in the face of new Neuroi power, which had only grown stronger and more innovative since the destruction of the Super Hive and presumably the Neuroi High Command. The remaining hives were proving to be an even greater threat than all others combined. And now he was left with precious few resources to fight them with. “What about our remaining forces in Africa, are they still combat-capable?”

“Hardly sir. Rommel’s troops are on the run and almost out of supplies. The Neuroi have a chokehold on Gibraltar, and the remaining fleet units in the Mediterranean and Atlantic can’t guarantee a breakout at their current strength level and with the new submarine fleet. Whats left of the Afrikakorps are on their own.”

Eisenhower sighed in admittance of defeat as he gestured for his aide to walk out and let him think alone. A Neuroi navy. Neuroi witches. Neuroi bending lasers and new “plasma” weapons. The list of sheer bullshit now crossing his desk made him wonder if all their previous victories now had any point in the face of such losses and the serious prospect of losing all of Europa once again.

And then there was the phone call from the President. Vladivostok Hive had deployed two super-bombs via high-speed high-altitude bombers, each of them capable of destroying an entire city or fleet. And if Romania was in range of Vladivostok, then so was the west coast of Liberion. Without Witches, there was nothing that could intercept those weapons or prevent the Neuroi from building as many as they pleased.

The President asked if there were any alternatives. He could offer none.

The President then asked if there was a chance of a negotiated settlement with the now talkative Neuroi. He did not know if it was possible, but would try.

The President asked if there was anything he could do. Eisenhower could only ask for reinforcements as soon as possible. Reinforcements that might never make it if the seas were in enemy hands.

All he could do now was wait for the enemy’s next move. And pray for a miracle.

“Momma.... Momma....”

“Hang in there just a little longer! You’re going to live! Please!” Yoshika gritted her teeth as she laid her healing hands on a Romania cadet witch bleeding from a gut wound. She lost count of how many people she tried to save, and how many died in her hands. Her hands were covered in blood, but she refused to stop her from saving just one more life.

The rest of the Witches present could only watch in silence as the truck ambled along the road escorted by hovering Neuroi sorceresses on all sides. Hartman and Barkhorn were silent at the wheel of the truck, while Lynette and Charlotte and a pair of wounded cadets could only watch helplessly as Yoshika desperately struggled to save another witch far too young to be on the battlefield.

In her earpiece, Lynette could still hear the others over the radio.

*All units, this is CP. Stand down and lay down arms. All hostilities are to cease immediately. Stand down and surrender.*

*You fucking serious CP! We can’t surrender to these guys!*

*Rico, stand down. We’re finished, we can’t do anything more!*

*This is Captain Valca to all remaining units, lay down arms and proceed to nearest city. We’ve lost. Do not engage Neuroi units. I repeat, do not engage. Stand down and regroup at nearest city or rally point. God help us all.*

*Anyone see where the Witches went? Someone tell me they got out of there!*

She pulled the radio bead out of her ear, unable to listen to any more. It was difficult to remember that they were winning just six months ago. Then everything changed for the worse. Far worse. And now they were prisoners of war. The Sorceresses projected images of other Witches in captivity to show they would be kept alive. But only just so. Was this her fate, after fighting so hard?

The cadet coughed again, and Yoshika let out a sigh in relief as she fell back into Lynette’s chest passed out in exhaustion while the cadet was attended to by the others to bandage her wounds. At least one more life was coming out of here alive.

But so many others had died. And now there was nothing they could do.

“I’m sorry Yoshika...” Lynette quietly muttered. For what she was sorry for, she didn’t know.
