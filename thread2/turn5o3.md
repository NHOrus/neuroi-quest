#The Coming Tide

I can't remember the last time the Neuroi actually pulled me out of my room. They'd strapped me to a table and scanned me with a few little things, back then, and then immediately sent me back. I'd resisted, but at this point I can barely even bother to curse the robots that drag me along. At the very least, it's a welcome reprieve from the music. So I let them lead me, only bothering to slowly toddle along like a newborn babe. I've paced my cell hundreds of times by now, but it's been a while since I actually walked in a straight line for more than ten feet. It feels somewhat odd, like my legs are leaning to the left. I growl.

It's then, though, that we approach something odd. A door. I haven't actually seen any doors in this place yet, just more and more walls that somehow retract into themselves on the command of the Neuroi. This is a true door, though; knob, wood, and as I stare at it I realize there's even a little cross hanging from it. What? Since when were the Neuroi interested in religion!?

Apparently I paused too long, though. The two bots at my sides give me a none-too-gentle shove, their metallic fingers scraping against my bare back. I scowl back at them but open the door, passing through to find myself in a large white room. Directly opposite me, I see an odd sight. I'd heard reports of the old Neuroi Witches that the 501st fought, of course, and I'd personally faced the ones deployed in Karlsland. This machine, however, is... different.

It holds the same standard color scheme of all the other Neuroi, but the body is shaped like a man, and over it's shoulders rest a dusty, stained labcoat. It seems to be inspecting said labcoat warily, and I realize that rather than a blank expanse molded vaguely like a face, the Neuroi machine has a paler shade of pinkish-red on the front of the head, with a thin line below a bulge and two red-glowing eyes that look up to me. I shiver and hesitate, unnerved by the appearance of the creature. It looks like some demented molding of the pilots, or perhaps a doctor, and as I approach I realize it's even wearing a thin set of glasses made out of the same red-black material as the rest of it's body, though there doesn't appear to be any lenses.

Out of the white expanse rises a small hair, seemingly sized for me. I notice that the odd machine is seated in a similar chair, though now that I look beneath, indents of red run from the bottom and dissappear into the rest of the room. I can't tell where it begins or ends. I stand for a moment, ears twitching as the door slams shut behind me, and wait. What does this thing want? Why does it look so... human?

"I believe," the machine says, and I flinch at the harsh voice that grates out, though it smoothes quickly. "that it is polite amongst human society to offer a chair to guests. So, sit. We have things to talk about." I glare at it, but sit nonetheless, glad to have a seat that isn't hard metal. It feels incredibly comfortable, and for a moment my eyes lull as I contemplate just falling asleep. But then I remember the machine in front of me and jerk upright, a furious glare in my eyes and my face starting to burn with fury I haven't felt for a long, long time.

"What about?" I spit out, leaning forward.

The machine leans back, seemingly unconcerned with my rage. "The end of your species," it replies bluntly. I flinch back, fear jolting through me. Oh no. Oh god no it hasn't - "Don't worry," it seems to snap. "Humanity is still alive and kicking, infuriating things. No thanks to the Director, that incompetent ass," it mutters to itself, seemingly not intending for me to hear. My eyebrows raise in confusion. Director? Incompetent? Why does it seem so... human?

"Anyway," it continues, the voice seemingly gaining inflection and emotion the more it speaks. "I'm here to offer you a deal, and share some information I'm sure concerns both of us." I glare, hands gripping the arms of my chair with all the enhanced strength I can muster in my weakened state.

"Oh yeah?" I spit out, leaning forward. "Please, tell me, how can I ever help you!? Why!?" I release a growl, ears flickin behind my head. This fucking bastard thinks I'm going to betray my people....

And then he des something I didn't expect. He laughs. I've never heard a machine laugh, but it sounds... less grating than I would have thought. There's an electronic buzz underneath it, but it sounds genuinely mirthful, if tinged with something I can't quite identify. I'm baffled, and what would normally have fanned my anger even higher just sets me to frowning. What the hell is so funny? What is with this damn Neuroi? Finally, though, he stops laughing and leans against one side of his chair, one hand supporting his head in a disturbingly human gesture.

"You'll help me because if you don't, we both die. All the Neuroi on this planet, and all the humans, and every other living thing. You see, we're not the only Neuroi around. There's a group that doesn't like us. Hive 302," he shivers, and I can't help but sneer, "is a rival of ours, and they've sent some soldiers to kill off our little mining operation." He looks at me, seeming to expect instant comprehension, beore sighing. "Here, let me explain. Or show you, I suppose." He makes a small gesture with his hand, and the room... chnges.

I can't help but gasp as we're pulled into darkness. For a brief moment all I can do is breathe, wondering if I'm about to be killed, before I realize that I can see a pinprick of light. And then I see more. They keep appearing in front of me, at first slow, but then faster, faster, dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon hundreds until I can't even imagine how man there are. They form masive swirling colors of light in the darkness, and I involuntarily stand to stretch a finger out. I'm surrounded by lights that form vast, incomprehensible lightshows, and they slowly solidify into great spirals, bright and beautiful and epic in scope.

One in particular seems to gow larger and larger and larger, until all the other lights in the universe are bloted out by the sheer mesmerizing beauty of this single spiral. A single brilliant ball of light, from which trillions of smaller dots spread out to form an epic swirling vortex of color and brightness against the absolute black of space. It spreads out a dozen arms that seem to reach forth, and I let m fingers trail against it to feel something not-quite-solid brushing against them.

My breath has caught and for a few spare moments, I can't help but marvel at the beauty. But then a voice speaks out, low, warm, right behind me, and there's an electronic buzz beneath it that brings me falling from my euphoric admiration.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

I agree, but I shake my head just to contradict the machine. I don't bother turning around, but I do brush off the metal hand that lands on my shoulder - surprisingly warm - with an angry grunt. He just sighs, and points to one particular cluster of stars in on of the arms. "That," he begins, "is where we are. Earth." The spiral spins around rapidly, before seeming to zoom in on a long strand of stars. "And that, is where Hive 302 primarily takes their cup of tea in the morning. The Neuroi aren't all on the same side, and we've been pissy with these guys for quite a while. It's only a few months ago, though, that the rivalry between our two hives errupted into all-out war. 302 decided to send people to destroy all of our mining operations, which includes us." The map - a map, I now realize, a map far greater in scope than any I could have ever imagined - comes back to the previous cluster of stars, before zooming in and in and in until can see Earth, alongside the rest of our solar system.

"They're sending a group, it would translate at PMC, here, in order to kill us. However, the Neuroi Empire's primary stance on natives is kill them all. If they beat us, that means you die. That's why I'm oping you can tell your military that preparing for something worse than us is in their best interests." I frown, then step away.

"Worse than you? How could they be worse than you?" The entity grins, and then he makes another motion. I can see and feel how the scene has changed behind me, but I feel a sense of dread fill me.

"You didn't really think I'm representative of the Neuroi's military might, did you?"

His tone is mocking, but also... sad, and weary. I growl, dismissing the brief curiosity about his emotions from my head. He's Neuroi. It is Neuroi. They don't feel. It's pretending. Still, I turn around to look... and find myself horrified.

This is... I don't know how to describe it. As I watch, worlds burn under concentrated plasma fire. Stars erupt into brilliant black holes that consume everything around. Soldiers fire weapons that seem to carve entire countries apart. Death. Destruction. Murder. Machine after machine after machine. War against soe strange, walking rock-like beings. Fires that burn bright and wide enough to be seen from space.

I trn away, pale faced and shaky. Is... this what we've been facing? I look at the Neuroi, but instead of looking smug, he just looks grim. He seems to be watching his own show, watching as worlds are tuned into dessicated husks and trillions killed. He seems to be watching, and I think I see... disappointment?

He shakes it off, before the black expanse of space and horrors of war beyond my imagining are reduced to nothing more than the white room yet again. He turns to me. "I want you to warn them. They probably won't believe you, but at the very least, you can tell them that more of the Neuroi are coming. And they're coming with bigger guns than I have." I can't help but gape at him, before a question comes to mind.

"If... if that's the kind of technology, if those are the weapons they have... then what use are humans?" It's a desperate, pleading question that scratches at my throat. The machine just grins, and I feel a sliver of fear.

"These are just PMCs. They have better weapons than I do, but they don't have anything quite on the level of the full military. Besides... you humans are crazy. I never would've thought it possible for a biological to tear apart three different infantry bots with one hand and half their brain missing, yet I saw that a thousand-fold in the Karlsland battle. I don't really want to kill you. I'm just a scientist. It's just... protocol."

I gape, before yelling, flinging my hand out. "PROTOCOL!? You've murdered millions of people! How in the hell is that protocol!?"

He just sighs, shaking his head. "The same way anything is. Do you object if you have to dissect a few frogs to graduate from college? Do you call your people monsters for killing and eating thousands of cows?" I growl, sorely tempted to attack right then and there.

"No! But those aren't people, those are animals, and we don't... we don't destroy entire planets! We're not animals!"

"No. You're not." I back up, suddenly nervous. The machine has a creepy grin on it's face, and it leans in close, the glowing red eyes getting larger, swirls of something I can't quite identify inside them. "You are far from animals. You're something new entirely. I've never seen a species that can casually break he laws of physics by instinct, or that can manipulate the energy so easily. I've never seen a people capable of creating shields or fighting when they should be dead a hundred times over. Never before."

He frowns, then, and backs up. "And I doubt I ever will again." He turns around, leaving through the door. But before it closes, he turns. I can just make out the outline of his glasses against the darkness outside the room. "You will be released. Tell them what you want. Warn them. And pray, for the both of us."
