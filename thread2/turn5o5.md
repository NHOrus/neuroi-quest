#Captivity, part 1

I don't know how long I've been here. Weeks. Maybe months. The food has been brought to me a hundred and nineteen times, and while it does feel regular, I don't know exactly how far apart the meals are.

The sludge they feed me is tasteless, which makes it just a tiny bit better than semolina. I hate it. Hate. Hate. Hate.

But I don't want to die.

I started speaking to myself after the seventh meal. They say that it is a hallmark of insanity. Well, fuck them, because the silence was driving me insane much faster.

My cell is roughly four by four paces, and the ceiling is... just high enough for me not to be able to reach it even if I jump. No idea how high that actually is. All surfaces — the walls, the floor, the ceiling — are made of the same material that the Neuroi fighers are made of. It's neither warm nor cold, and very smooth; the hex-grid on it is made of some kind of semi-transparent crystal, but I can't feel the seams... if there are seams. The floor is slightly inclined from one corner of the room to the opposite; in the lowest point is the... waste disposal chute, and the food dispenser slides out of the wall near the highest.

They provide illumination by making the hex-grid crystals in the ceiling glow. It's a harsh light, almost like the afternoon sun at its maximum intensity, but I've discovered that they dial the light down if I don't move for long stretches of time. They also seem to know that humans need sleep; when I lie down and close my eyes, the light dims almost immediately.

There is no furniture in the cell. Most importantly, there's no bed.

They are watching me quite thoroughly, though. Soon after I started hurting all over from sleeping on the floor, they made a section of the floor... soft. Softish. It still has the same texture as the rest of the floor, but when I lay down to sleep one day, the floor under me became soft. Scared the hell out of me, too; in the first moments, I thought I was going to sink right through.

There is nothing to do but exercise and think. I was never a fan of the physical stuff, but I can't just sit on my ass all the time. Because then I start to remember the battle. The roar of human machines advancing and the almost inaudible whine the Neuroi fliers make when they weave through the hail of lead we unleash on them. The cracks of guns and the sizzle of flesh being burned by the lasers.

Speaking distracts me from those thoughts too. And singing. They say that my singing voice isn't very good. Well, fuck them, because I am here and they... they...

They will come for me, I hope, even if they don't like my singing. Then I will be silent until they take me away. But no longer. I don't think I will be able to really stop singing now.

-----

And then, one day, *they* come for me.

Two twisted parodies of the Witches and a big... harness. It has an indentation on it in the shape of a human body, and some things around it that can only be unlatched restraints.

It is obvious what they want me to do. To step up there and willfully strap myself onto the contraption. They are waiting patiently, not making any threatening moves.

For a while, I consider attacking them. I've been saving up some magic, and I think I could take them out if I rush them. Their false Witches are not as good as the real deal.

Do I dare to, though?
