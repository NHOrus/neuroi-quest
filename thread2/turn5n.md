Turn 5 Neuroi News!

Broadcaster Bombing!: Sabotage has destroyed several important civilian news stations across the Empire! The perpatrator is unknown, but the action has been denounced by both those in the Government and the MUS.

Honor at Vasaii: Ten years into the Fahrong War, the Vasaii Cluster was the scene of a massive battle between the Neuroi Empire and the Fahrong Conglomerate. Both sides had massive colonies in the Cluster, and neither was willing to give it up. In the following, two year long battle, trillions of Neuroi and Fahrong fought and died. Heroes were made and destroyed, and the Cluster became little more than a graveyard, useless for military operations or civilian inhabitants. Today, it seems that veterans from both sides, in areas surrounding and inside the Cluster have made an unofficial truce, to honour the memory of every soldier and civilian lost. The Empire has denounced this as treason, but many of the participants have too much influence for authorities to punish them.
May this Nightmare be over soon.

Human Intelligence

Barbarians at the Gate!: The nation of Romagna, thought safe from the Neuroi, has suffered a blitzkrieg by the aliens, pushing the Romagnans almost completely off their homeland. Venezia has recently fallen, and the other nations of the Meditteranean have put aside their differences to stop the Neuroi from advancing any further. No one wants to think about what may happen if two Neuroi Hives link up.

Out-Foxed: A Neuroi attack on Libya has been driven back due to the efforts of Karlsland Field Marshall Erwin Rommel. This has provided a desperately needed shot in the arm to human morale in Africa, which has been flagging ever since the loss of Egypt.

Choo-Choo!: The Neuroi in Vladivastok have made a push up through the Orussian territories in Siberia. While they have been under heavy fire from the human fleets, so far the Neuroi advance continues at a slow, but steady rate.

Strange Actions: Scouts that managed to observe the Neuroi territory have reported several new Fortifications being created. Unlike the others, these seem to be massive cannons designed to fire into orbit. Speculations as to what could frighten the Neuroi enough to create these weapons is abound.
