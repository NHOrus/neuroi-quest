#Neuroi Pants Pt. 2

Alicia’s eyes widened as her show was once again interrupted by static. Around the rec-room, the other Witches looked up as well, a mixture of nervousness and interest filling the air as they all wondered if they were about to get a repeat of that ~~fascinating~~ ~~stunning~~ *evil* Neuroi ~~commercial~~ *propaganda*. A moment later, the static cleared, revealing the same Neuroi Witch as before (or at least Alicia thought it was the same one, they all looked identical.)

**"Hello, ladies, how are you? Fantastic! Do any of you look like me? No. Can you fly like me? Yes!"​**

“Why would we want to look like you?” someone snapped, only to be shushed as the smooth, almost sensual voice of the Neuroi continued to speak. Flushing at that thought, Alicia almost missed the next part.

**"Should you use superior Neuroi Striker Units? I don’t know; do you like the feeling of adventure?"​**

With that, the fake Witch lifted off and floated sideways along what looked like an assembly line of some sort, building the ~~gorgeous~~ *hideo...* oh who was she kidding... Striker that had been advertised in the previous commercial.

**"Do you want a Striker that feels like it can boost you into outer space while simultaneously sewing and dressing you in the pants you have so long been denied? Of course you do."​**

Once again, the red-headed Witch from before came into view, the new Striker slipping directly from the assembly line onto her legs (which had pants on again, the lucky little…). Then, without any warning, she went blasting her off into the sky so fast that Alicia almost got whiplash trying to track her. A moment later, the Neuroi flew after her at a more measured pace, still talking.

**"Take off! On the best flight of your life! So ladies, should you be able to fly like a Neuroi?"​**

Suddenly, the sun appeared from the clouds behind the Neuroi in a dazzaling display, causing a few of the younger Witches to let out ooohs and aaahs. Blinking, Alicia could have sworn that the strange red markings around the fake’s face shifted to form a cocky smirk as it held up a pair of pants.

**"You tell me."​**

With that, a jaunty little tune played and the commercial ended, leaving silence in its wake. Finally, someone spoke up.

“I really, *really* need some of those.”
