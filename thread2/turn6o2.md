"... I really miss them, you know?"

"Huh?"

"My parents. My friends. Hans."

"Oh."

Leslie sighs, and even despite never having seen her, I can imagine her hugging her knees to her chest, leaning onto the wall near the intercom.

Then again, maybe I'm just projecting. Me doing that doesn't mean that everybody does.

"Can you tell me about them?" I ask, partly to keep the conversation going, partly because of genuine interest.

She sighs again, and I imagine her lips curving up in a small smile.

"Well, we live in a nice town — not exactly what you'd call small, but not big enough to be called a city, you know? And it's kind of old, and while they are starting to build those high-rises with cheap flats on the outskirts, the majority of the town is... maybe three to five floors? It's really down to the ground, and the people reflect that. For the most part.

"My dad's inherited a small bakery. A family business. We're pretty well known in our part of the town, and even with the mass-produced bread being available, we're still having a lot of clients. Most of them are regulars, of course, but sometimes you can go down to the cafe and see a couple new faces enjoying a croissant with a cup of coffee, or a raspberry pie with some tea, or something like that. Tourists, just people looking for a quick bite."

My stomach growls quietly. I really hope Leslie didn't hear that. She's the kind of person to worry needlessly about other people, and given our situation, there's plenty of things to be worrying about already. Besides, it's not like I don't eat well; the Neuroi seem to have figured out a better diet for us Witches, and it's been some time since I've last felt that nagging not-quite-hunger that the nutrient paste used to leave you with. But Leslie always describes her family's produce in such a way that you just can't help but want a bite.

"That's how he met my mom. A waitress got ill, and he had to serve the clients himself in addition to watching over the dough. And it was a good day, so everything was so frantic... He stumbled over something when he was bringing her order over, and managed to catch the tray just in time to not have it spill all over her. Got covered in powdered sugar for his troubles. And then he began apologizing and promising to bake her another set of whatever it was she wanted free of charge, and then she just looks at him and says, 'That's so sweet of you'..."

She giggles at the pun, and I smile along.

"So, yeah. My mom just got transferred to that town's Air Force base — she's a scientist, specializing in the aircraft performance — and he just captured her heart with a single glance. Or that's what they've been telling me, anyway."

"That sounds really romantic," I comment.

"Heh. It does now, yes. Dad always has a few choice words about how he had to wash the sugar off, though. And there was that one time when I got myself covered in it too, so I can confirm, there's nothing romantic in being a sticky fly-bait."

I chuckle, imagining Leslie's mother reaction to that.

"You know how the books always tell you about children of cooks being fat?" Leslie continues. "Well, maybe that's true for the rich, but in a working family, you don't have the time to sit around and stuff yourself. I was... hmm... yeah, I think I was twelve when dad bought me my first bike and sent me to deliver stuff farther than around the block. I knew the neighborhood pretty well by that point, but it's with the wheels that the town really opened up to me.

"And then I discovered my love for speed. The feeling of wind in my face as I barrel down the hill. The thrill of weaving through the crowd without slowing down, the pastry still warm in the basket.

"Of course, with the kind of punishment I was heaping on the poor contraption, it's no wonder that the bike broke down pretty fast. But I had some money squirreled away, and I really didn't want to tell dad I broke his gift, so I went to the workshop to get it fixed. And that's where I met Hans."

She pauses for a couple of seconds, and I'm just about to ask a leading question when she continues on her own.

"He wasn't even an apprentice at the time, just mucked around at the mechanical workshop where his brother worked. He always loved to tinker with the machines though, and the machines seem to love him back. He makes fixing even the most difficult problems easy as pie. And he's really good at explaining things. So I went in, all apprehensive like and shy and scared, and he just calls me over and has me explain the problem and then goes on to tinker with my bike before I even finish, and— alakazam! Didn't take him five minutes."

Leslie heaves a wistful sigh.

"Long story short, we just... clicked, you know? It was completely platonic at first, for several years, just a very good friendship. I filched some pastry for him and the workshop crew, he took me for test drives on things he was fixing. Cars I didn't like, too big and clunky and slow, but motorbikes... I fell in love with them instantly. Power and speed in such a lean package. Almost like a Striker. Except that I didn't even know I was a Witch."

"How did you find out, actually?"

"Heh. It all ties back to that. One time I was speeding down a street, and miscalculated a turn. Smashed right into the wall. Somehow managed to shield myself and not get turned into paste. That couldn't be said for the bike, though, hehe.

"Of course, mom and dad freaked out. Dad because I could've gotten myself killed, and because we had to pay for the bike. Mom though... She realized right away that with my power manifesting, I was going to be drafted. She even had to report me herself, the regs were extremely clear on that part." Leslie pauses, then continues in a soft voice, "She cried all that night. She thought nobody would hear, but I was too full of excitement and couldn't sleep."

I am silent. Nothing comes to mind that I could say. Maybe it's meant to be that way with such things?

"Thankfully, they stationed me at the same base my mom was at. Not that I saw her too often, or that we had a lot of opportunities to talk even when we met. I was always so busy with the training, and she had her airplanes to examine and whatnot.

"There were probably two good things in the whole situation. First is that I suddenly found myself to be one of the fastest things in the world. It was always so distant, you know? Reading about all those legendary people like Cobb and Dittmar and Yeager, I never really thought that I was going to be competing with them. It was... surreal. And the people around me all shared the passion for flight. 'We are not just feathers; we are a Wing.' It felt really nice to belong."

"And the second? Um, the second good thing?"

"That Hans was still with me. They noticed him too, during the investigation. One day I just met him in the hallway on the base. He signed on as a mechanic, they were in really short supply at the time. Mom had to fight to have him attached to her team, and then he got the scare of his life when he got introduced and recognized the surname."

"What, were you, like, already *together* together?"

"Well... Kind of. I didn't realize the full extent of my feelings yet. We hadn't even kissed at that point. But mom did find out somehow about that guy her daughter spent too much time with."

"What happened next?"

"Neuroi happened. I have good shields and good speed, so I was never in danger. They all still worried for me. Embarrassed me all the time. Then the Super-hive fell, and we celebrated, and..."

"Aaaand?" I ask, even if I can already guess what she's hesitating about.

"And he proposed to me. Bought me a beautiful ring. Nothing fancy, just a golden band with an engraving on the inside. 'Just like you,' he said, 'streamlined and perfect on the outside, but it's what's inside that I love the most.' I was so touched..."

Leslie sniffs.

"We made plans for after the war. A small house, a garage for the toys, a garden for the kids... The victory was closer than ever, we took out the main force, how hard could it be to capitalize on that..." She sniffs again, louder this time. "And then—"

*Beep*
