#Turn 6, June 1946: War

###Romagna's Last Stand

Most of the Allied reinforcements are wreckage in the harbour after your initial attack, but a few ships managed to land and deploy their cargoes of tanks, airplanes, and some other devices your spy units weren't able to get a good look at. Whatever they were, the Allies still have a significant presence of entrenched, armed, and very pissed off soldiers and militia.  
![â€‹Romagnia invasion state](../images/romagnia_invasion2.gif)  
Most of the Allied professional reinforcements, including the odd packages, have landed in Taranto, well behind enemy lines. The Atlantic Fleet is moving in to engage the Romagnan fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Ottoman Fleet in the Ionian Sea. However, for a major effect, they'll have to focus on one of the two. Which one?  

- **[ ]** Target the Romagnan Fleet, otherwise your forces will be bombarded for the rest of the campaign, and who knows what Karlsland has given this experienced force?  
- **[X]** Focus on the Ottomans. With them gone, Suez can send his forces to help you in Italy.

---
Whatever happens on the water, you still have to deal with getting through from the North yourself. The Romagnans have been busy, and much of the mountainous terrain has been fortified with bunkers and hideouts filled with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry. Most of it is primitive and relatively weak, but considering the huge numbers, it will be a pain to deal with.  
Additionally, the Venezian and Greek fleets have deployed near Bari and Brindisi, ready to rain support fire down upon your forces if they move too close.  
And, of course, there are Witches stationed in almost every city, and it is believed that the 501st and 504th JFWs are present to help hold off your forces.

You have several aerial transports, though they are fragile, as well as some jamming capabilities. However, you lack solid intelligence on the exact numbers and positions of the enemy forces, and little is known about the Allied missile capabilities aside from their obvious lethality.

*How are you going to wipe out Romagna as a nation?*

####Berlin forces
- Primarily move east to secure the areas of Bari, Brindsi, and Taranto to avoid coming under fire by the Romagnan Fleet.
- Use groups of small flyers traveling *as far* above AA range as possible to act as advanced spotters for our main forces *focusing especially on finding enemy artillery*. When an AA or anti-tank hideout/bunkers are found, jam them and use artillery to destroy them. Flyers and witches can insure escapees/observers don't get word back to the main forces *being careful to not be lured into an ambush. (emphasis due to AA missiles, we don't know their exact range.)*
- Use Witches to guard our artillery from attacks until we engage in actual combat/attacking the bunkers. Should enemy witches engage us, attack them with MkII Witches and large flyers along with the artillery providing covering fire when possible.

Admiral Carlo Bergamini stared at the squadron of Orussian Night Witches. "You're certain?" The commander nodded. "I could hear them, sir. The static was from underwater. They have a navy, and subs." Bergamini cursed and stared at the map. Ever since the Super-Hive had gone down, it had been one surprise after another with the Neuroi. Now they had a navy, the one thing humanity was absolutely not prepared to deal with.

Now he had to deal with a fleet of alien submarines, with a fleet with minimal anti-submarine weaponry while trying to hold off the crazy and unpredictable Neuroi army to his north and he still had no idea where the Neuroi would go-  
He checked the map again.  
"They'll hit the Ottomans." He muttered. "Sir?" "The subs will try to hit the Ottomans." He said more firmly. "That'll let the Neuroi in Egypt hit us from the South. We'll be cut off, surrounded, and wiped out. I... know they will. Get the fleet ready, and tell the Ottomans I have an idea. We'll need your help as well."

---
The Atlantic Fleet begins to emerge slightly above water to allow their powerful laser cannons to open fire. The Ottoman fleet is nearby, within easy range, and, as it seems, completely unaware of their imminent demise.  
"Just like target practi-"  
*BOOM!*  
"What the-"  
Before the Atlantic Fleet can react, the Orussian 588th Night Witches Squadron is diving down on them, all equipped with an arsenal of heavy weaponry. Auto-cannons blast out volleys of magically-enhanced shells that blow apart the smaller escort Subs.A couple Night Witches drop specially made bombs on one of the Submersible Battleships, blasting apart its hull and core.

Things get worse as the Ottoman fleets almost immediately begins opening fire, clearly alert and with its fire being guided by a couple of Witch spotters. Trying to retreat, the Neuroi run straight into the Romagnan fleet, leaving them surrounded, under fire, and with several volleys of primitive depth charges and other explosives being dropped into the water, unable to retreat.

Attempts to shoot down the Night Witches are disastrous. Magical jamming causes Neuroi targeting to go haywire, and several times the more agile ones send lasers careening into Neuroi hulls, causing little real damage but massive amounts of embarrassment. Not that Atlantic doesn't fight back, and he causes some damage, but it isn't enough.

**Atlantic Neuroi Losses: `4` Submersible Battleships, `30` Escort Subs**  
**Human Losses: `2` Battleships, `14` Lesser ships, `2` Witches**

He calls you.
"So, ah, Suez, about that fleet-"
"Human bullshit?"
"Ah... Yeah, human bullshit."
"Fucking magic?"
"Fucking magic."

---
"Sir!"  
"What now?" Bergamini demanded.  
"The Neuroi in Egypt are launching a massive assault! We've got armored columns pushing across Lybia and the Sinai Peninsula, all equipped with unknown weapons!  
Reports say General Montgomery and the entire Britannian expeditionary force has been wiped out! They need naval support, or we could lose all of Afrika!"  
Of course. It would have been too easy otherwise. Why wouldn't the Neuroi bring out yet another superweapon just when things started looking good for them.  
"Have our forces move to the Afrikan coast. We'll have to leave Romagna to fend for itself for now."

---
Your Small Types act as spotters and bait for the human hideouts. On one hand, they manage to spot and clear out many of the human militia hideouts. On the other hand, they take decent losses themselves, and you're pretty sure there are many more that you didn't get.  
**Neuroi Losses: `12` Small Type Groups**  
**Human Losses: `Over 1` Million Militia**  
Things get worse when you begin advancing. Apparently the Venezian and Greek Fleets were exempt from the order to move south, and continue blasting your forces merrily. Volleys of Laser Artillery strike back, but don't do enough damage to keep your forces advancing.  
Bari is only taken after a brutal fight, and things don't seem to be improving. Especially when an enterprising group of Witches launches a suicide attack on your artillery while they're recharging. They all die, of course, but not before half your artillery is gone.  
**Neuroi Losses: `20` Infantry Bot Divisions, `4` Anti-Tank Bot Divisions, `8` Neuroi Walker Groups, `8` Small Type Flyer Groups, `5` Medium Type Flyer Groups, `2` Large Type Flyer Groups, `1` Sorceress Group, `5` Multi-Laser Artillery Groups**  
**Human Losses: `150,000` Infantry, `1.5` Million Militia, `12` ships, `16` Witches**  

And even with all the damage you've done, you've still got heavily motivated, armed, and entrenched Romagnans in Brindisi and Taranto, with a massive human professional army moving out of Taranto to take out your invasion for-

####Two Nuclear Fission explosions detected
What the-  
"H-hey there."  
"VV? What is-"  
"W-well, you remember when I said I wanted to help you right, a-and it looked like the humans were causing you trouble and I didn't want you getting hurt so-"  
"Spit it out please."  
"I made a couple atomic fission bombs in my spare time and had that dropped onto Taranto and that human fleet! Sorry I didn't ask permission."  

---
**Human Losses: `Taranto` Destroyed, `Greek` and `Venezian` Fleets annihilated, `all` surviving infantrymen, `all` surviving tanks, `all` but `150` surviving airplanes, `all` but `18` Witches**  
Well... that certainly evens the odds. The humans at Brindisi are now cut off, and the southernmost tip of Romagna is still under human control.But things are starting to look up.  

*How do you want to finish off Romagna?*

Romagna's Last Stand: Part 3
[x]Broadcast over every radio channel (if we can get the witches magic radios all the better) and offer terms of surrender. If they refuse, blow the remaining planes out of the sky and repeat the terms for surrender.
"Humans of Romagna, this is the Karlsland Neuroi Hive. Your armies have been destroyed, your fleets removed and your allies scattered to the wind. Surrender and you will live. I have no desire to commit pointless slaughter but I can and will should you force my hand."
-[x] All soldiers and witches are to stand down immediately.
-[x] Enemy soldiers are given parole. They hand over their weapons and agree not to rejoin the fight and we will allow them to join the civilians in Neuroi controlled Romagnan towns/cities.
-[x] Witches are be taken into custody as PoWs*. Show proof that Sarah Lebs, Cecilia Harris, Matsuda Shouko, Delia Jeram, and Ottilie Kittel all live as indications that we are not simply going to kill them off.
--[x] Should at any point human forces retaliate after surrendering we will consider the agreement broken and recommence the attack.

After the humans get over their initial astonishment of Neuroi communicating in methods other than that of lasers, they take stock of the situation.
Them: Having rag-tag militia forces, no naval support, no way to retreat, and just seeing the last of their actual military get bombed in spectacular fashion.
Against them: A still very intact Neuroi army that will enjoy total air supremacy.

The last remaining humans drop their weapons and surrender in droves. Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily, lacking any real resistance also give up happily. While a few holdouts take a bit of clearing out and losses, it's nothing major.
Neuroi Losses: 2 Infanry Bot Divisions
Human Losses: 6 Million Humans surrendered/captured


"Yoshika?"
"Uh... Lynne?" Yoshika Miyafuji winced as she tended to one of the wounded Witch cadets. The 501st had been run ragged trying to counter the movements of the Neuroi, and everyone was exhausted. Things had gotten worse when the Neuroi advance had split the JFW in two.
"You heard that? What do you think we should do?" The Britannian girl checked her rifle. Five rounds left, no extra clips.
Erica Hartmann winced and took a look at her broken MG42. "What can we do?"
Nothing. And they all knew it.
