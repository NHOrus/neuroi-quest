Romagna's Last Stand: Part 1

Most of the Alied reinforcements are wreckage in the harbour after your initial attack, but a few ships managed to land and deploy their cargoes of tanks, airplanes, and some other devices your spy units weren't able to get a good look at. Whatever they were, the Allies still have a significant presence of entrenched, armed, and very pissed off soldiers and militia.

Most of the Allied professional reinforcements, including the odd packages, have landed in Taranto, well behind enemy lines. The Atlantic Fleet is moving in to engage the Romagnan fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Ottoman Fleet in the Ionian Sea. However, for a major effect, they'll have to focus on one of the two. Which one?

[] Target the Romagnan Fleet, otherwise your forces will be bombarded for the rest of the campaign, and who knows what Karlsland has given this experienced force?
[] Focus on the Ottomans. With them gone, Suez can send his forces to help you in Italy.

Whatever happens on the water, you still have to deal with getting through from the North yourself. The Romagnans have been busy, and much of the mountainous terrain has been fortified with bunkers and hideouts filled with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry. Most of it is primitive and relatively weak, but considering the huge numbers, it will be a pain to deal with.
Additionally, the Venezian and Greek fleets have deployed near Bari and Brindisi, ready to rain support fire down upon your forces if they move too close.
And, of course, there are Witches stationed in almost every city, and it is believed that the 501st and 504th JFWs are present to help hold off your forces.

You have several aerial transports, though they are fragile, as well as some jamming capabilities. However, you lack solid intelligence on the exact numbers and positions of the enemy forces, and little is known about the Allied missile capabilities aside from their obvious lethality.
