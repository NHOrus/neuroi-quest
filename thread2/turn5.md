#Turn 5, May 1946

Humans are stubborn.  
Of course, you've known that for a long time, but now you're really starting to appreciate how stubborn they are in the face of annihilation. It appears that the human nations surrounding the Mediterranean have decided that having two Neuroi Hives link up is vastly worse than their own troubles.  
They're right, but it is annoying. It will take a few months at least for the humans to be ready to launch their counterattack though, so you have time to prepare.  
You'd best make good use of it.  

On the bright side, you got a message from home.  


>Hive Cluster `302` has sent a `Private Fleet` to your location. Exact ETA unknown. Usage of Plasma Weaponry Authorized.

>P.S.: Tell `Suez` this makes us even for `Vasaii`.
