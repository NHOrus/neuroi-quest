#Captivity, part 1

A sardonic grin twists my lips. Yeah, right, I could attack them, I could maybe even take out these two... and then what? I don't even have any idea where on Earth I am, in the most literal sense. There's no way I could make it back home. Attacking now would be suicidal.

And as I said, I really want to live.

It might be strange, but I wasn't that afraid of death when I was attacking the Neuroi positions. I mean, yes, I did everything I could to not die, but... It's probably this feeling of utter helplessness that's firmly entrenched itself in my mind during all this time.

I resign myself to my fate and take a step forward. As I do that, I can feel some of my hope, my will to fight draining.

I walk to the... transporter and, turning around before it, lean into the human-shaped indent in it. It fits me snugly, like it was made specifically for me... Come to think of it, it probably was.

The shackles on my arms, legs and torso snap shut with a small hissing sound. They aren't overly constricting, I have some wiggle room in them and if I want to, I can hold myself still and not even feel them. Briefly I wonder at the gentleness of it all.

My subconscious doesn't care. The moment the restraints come in place, I am consumed with panic. The only word that comes to mind is claustrophobia, but that's supposed to be the fear of enclosed spaces, not restriction of movement.

And it's not like I need to know the word, right? I'm alone here, and words are used to communicate with others.

I strain to break out of the shackles, but they hold me easily. I trash around, but the contraption I'm tied to doesn't even wobble. It just flies serenely out of my cell and into a long hall, one false-Witch in front of me, one presumably behind.

And then we start accelerating. I feel what has to be at least several gees of force press me into the transporter. Curiously, there's no wind trying to tear my face off; must be some kind of shielding, even if I don't see anything resembling a witch's shield. Not that it should be surprising; I'm the only witch here.

The only human here.

Well, at least the movement broke me out of the panic attack I was having. Small mercies.

We pass some intersections and make some turns, all at the same breakneck speed. The transporter turns as it flies, so the acceleration forces are always pressing me directly into the slab behind my back. I should probably be thankful for that, as the turns were sharp enough that, were I to make them facing forward, I could've been torn in half by the torso shackle. Or at least noticeably hurt.

I don't have enough time to start seriously contemplating the care my captors are handling me with, as we arrive at our destination.

It's...

It's another cell. Just like mine. Maybe it is mine, it's not like I can navigate the labyrinthine prison.

The transporter releases me, and suddenly I almost collapse on the floor. Somehow, the trip took a lot of energy out of me.

The transporter flies out of the cell along with the false-Witches, and the door closes, seamlessly melding into the wall. I am alone, again. Reeling from the suddenness and senselessness of it all. What was that? Did they just transfer me to another cell? What was wrong with the previous one?

A short melodious tone tears through the silence, and suddenly a section of the floor near the left wall begins rising up. A large part of it stops soon, a smaller section rises a bit higher...

And I am left staring dumbly at the blocky chair that just grew out of the floor. Were I to sit on it, I'd be facing a wall across the room...

Well, the invitation is pretty clear. I approach the "chair" and touch it with my finger first. It's hard, just like the floor. Splendid.

I sit on it anyway, and suddenly the surface bends under me, becoming much more comfortable... just like that bed. Oh.

I sink further, deeper into the chair until it stops letting me. The material still doesn't seem to have any temperature; otherwise, it feels like being half-submerged in jelly. Probably. I have never been submerged in jelly before.

Another short tone attracts my attention to the wall directly before me. The hex-grid pattern on it blurs, and then a picture appears, spanning the whole wall.

It's a bird's eye view of a flight of Witches. I do not know any of them, but they seem familiar, as if I saw them somewhere briefly.

In the background, far far away — technically, below — the ground is visible. With a start, I recognize the terrain.

It's the site of the battle they took me from. And the witches are some of the new ones, now I remember seeing them in the mess hall. We've never been introduced.

There is no fighting yet. Is this before the attack began?

Why are they showing—

The picture on the wall begins moving. A video record, then, but a soundless one. The witches are flying down — that is, down from my perspective, so they are flying towards whatever it is that has the camera — some Neuroi flier, most likely — but below it. They don't seem to be aware that they are being watched.

There is a short beep, and the leading witch is highlighted by a whitish-blue outline. Then, with a crackle of static, a female voice shouts: "Scatter!"

I jerk in my seat and try to look around for the source of the voice, but the jelly around me suddenly solidifies, preventing me from moving.

The woman's voice sounds just like the little communicators we're issued to keep in touch with each other in the air.

Two short beeps are played, and immediately the witches on the picture split up, narrowly avoiding a barrage of cherry-red lasers. Then the video clip stops.

Then, the whole sequence is played back again. Witches flying, a beep, a witch is highlighted, the command is played, two beeps, witches scatter.

Alright, so far it's pretty simple. A flight commander warning her witches. What next?

Then the picture is replaced. On the left half, there are some white dots arranged in a V shape on black background. On the right... is me, sitting on the chair. Huh.

A beep. The picture of me is highlighted. The order to scatter is replayed, the same record with the static and that witch's voice. Two beeps. The dots on the left fly in different directions... just like the witches on the video!

The sequence is replayed again. So, I'm ordering the dots to scatter... okay.

The picture resets. Two beeps. The dots scatter. One beep. I'm highlighted, the order is played.

The picture resets. My image is left intact on the right, but on the left, the dots are replaced by a wireframe model of a girl.

Two beeps. The girl begins moving... walking.

One beep. My image is highlighted. Silence.

What's going on?

A harsh buzz sounds, and the picture is reset. The dots are back. Two beeps, scatter, one beep, order.

The picture resets. Two beeps, a girl walking. One beep. Silence, with me being highlighted.

... There's supposed to be an order. An order to walk.

*Oh.*

"Walk," I say. A chime sounds, and a pillar rises from the floor before me. From it, a bowl with the nutrient sludge is produced.

A food dispenser.

... Is that a *treat for a trick?!*

... It doesn't matter. I'm hungry. I don't want to die, and to stay alive, I need to eat. So I reach for the bowl.

I wonder, though... Are they going to give me a bowl of food for every correct answer?


---


No, they are not. The chime indicates correct actions, the buzz — incorrect ones.

We repeat the exercise with the orders, although now I have to order the wireframe girl to "stop".

I briefly consider saying something else, but decide not to.

Then I learn how to say "yes" and "no". The pillar in front of me grows two buttons, and a movie is played about how I should press the left one when a circle is paired up with another circle, and the right button if it's paired with a triangle.

Then the Neuroi have me teach them the words "yes" and "no", again through the reverse-order routine.

Then they show me a short clip of a small Neuroi fighter shooting down a Witch.

"No!" I shout, then smash the "no" button to reinforce.

A chime sounds.

Huh. Not shooting witches is correct? Imagine that.

Then they play another clip, now that of a witch shooting down a Neuroi fighter.

Um.

"Yes?"

Buzz. Wrong.

"No?"

Chime. Correct. No shooting Neuroi, either. Who'd have thought.

Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

"You want a cease-fire?!"

No answer.

The chair gently pushes me out of itself, so I stand up.

"You want a cease-fire after everything that you did?! Are you crazy?!"

The door opens, admitting two false-Witches and a transporter.

"Walk," says the room in my voice.

When we arrive to my cell, there's an addition to it. Near the food dispenser, two buttons are installed on the wall above a hex tile highlighted with the crystal lines. I recognize the "yes" and "no" buttons from the video room, but the function of the tile is unknown.

Do they control the food dispenser?

Never thought I'd really want an additional portion of the damned sludge, but here I am.

I press the "yes" button.

A beep sounds, and then the highlighted tile says in a slightly tinny, but an unmistakably frustrated feminine voice:

"What the hell?!"
