## Plan jwolfe 2.0

### Build Order (`6,000` RU):
- `91` Infantry Bot Divisions (`10` RU each)
- `29` Anti-Vehicle Bot Divisions (`10` RU each)
- `30` Neuroi Walker Groups (`25` RU each)
- `42` Small Type Flyer Groups (`20` RU each)
- `27` Medium Type Groups (`30` RU each)
- `10` Large Type Groups (`50` RU each)
- `10` Ultra-Heavy Groups (`100` RU each)
- `3` Neuroi Witch Mark 1 Groups (`300` RU each)

This is the third army you've rolled out in as many months. Maybe this one will even survive its first campaign!

### Actions:
- **Neuroi Fortress:** If you're going to hold off the humans, you need fortifications. Torpedo launchers, mines, Fortification Class Neuroi, all over your territory, new and old.(`2,000` RU)  
The start of the fortifications in Romagna and Karlsland does well. Torpedo Launchers line the entire coast, and heavy Fortifications and Mines will make it very difficult for the humans to dislodge you. They could still use further improvement, but they should make life difficult for an invader.  
**Reward:** Bonus to Rolls defending current territory

- **Technology Trade:** Who knows what you could get from the other Hives with your new tech?  
_Everything._ If we manage to crack Laser artillery and espionage offer them as well.  
 Also inform Suez about the message.  
**Results:** The technology exchange goes very well. Everyone's more than happy to gain new technology, and an exchange has been set up so that all technology will be shared among the Hives. You also learn that the Atlantic Hive is under new management, the old prick having been, er, "hit by a stray torpedo" (you try not to think about that too much, seeing as how torpedoes are guided weapons).  
Suez goes silent when you mention the message about Vasaii. Then he does the Neuroi equivalent of a nod, and promises you his help in the coming battles.  
He refuses to elaborate on what happened.  
**Reward:** _New Technology:_ `Neuroi Water Adaptation`, `Anti-Orbital Fortifications`, `Improved Unit Armour`  
`Suez` and `Atlantic` Assistance for Battle of Romagna  
_New Unit_: `Submersible Battleship` (Costs `400` RU) (Excellent v.s. Ships, Fortifications, Very Good against most other units, Decent v.s. Submarines, bombers, Witches)  
_New Unit:_ `Land Battleship` (Costs `1,200` RU) (Excellent v.s. Everything)

- **And That's for The Fourth Crusade!:** Venice is becoming a real thorn in your side. Fortunately, the only way the Allies can supply it is by sea. Perhaps you can deploy units to stop any ocean-going units from making it through. (`1020` RU)  
You take severe losses among your aerial units, but the massive resource influx means that you have enough to replace any losses. Any supply ships trying to find their way into Venice are sunk, and the city begins to starve. By the end of the month, the starving population and garrison has made a desperate attempt to break out, while the more important forces are quickly evacuated. In the aftermath, you move in, and take the city, securing your flank on the Italian Peninsula.  
**Reward:** Venice Captured. 750 RU salvaged

###Research Actions:
- **Laser Artillery:** After the supreme ass-kicking you got at the hands of human artillery, it might be good to make some of your own. (`800` RU)  
After experiments you decide that artillery that fired individual lasers would be very inefficient. Instead, you create what will become known as the Hwacha Class Neuroi. The size of the average truck, the Hwacha Class has emitters for dozens of lasers, all of which can be fired in quick succession. While helpless in close combat, slow, and with a large recharge time, the Hwacha can inflict massive devastation on enemies on the ground or in the air.  
**Reward:** `Multi-Laser Artillery Group` Unlocked ( Excellent v.s. Fortifications, Very Strong v.s. Most units at long range, Weak v.s. anything that can get close) (`75` RU per Group)


- **All Hail The Dice Gods!:** While they are captive, you have seen several humans praying to various deities for aid in some circumstances. You wonder, perhaps some study on this could help you gain this "Divine Favour"? (`800` RU)  
You fervently study the strange phenomenon known as Religion among the humans. It seems that throughout human history, various beliefs have popped up, based around the veneration of various entities. Sometimes it takes place in a form of worshipping ancestors, other times intangible deities. It also seems that when ever two Religions that contradict each other meet, the end result is usually violence.  
After over two weeks of utter bafflement, you feel as though inspiration has hit you, though you can't exactly place where it came from.  
"Fear not, little Neuroi, for the Dice Gods hath taken pity upon thee and thy Abysmal Rolls."  
**Reward:** In every GM Post, one failed action will be automatically re-rolled.

- **Espionage Action Get!:** You need to dedicate more to espionage. (`500` RU)  
You set aside a decent amount of power and infrastructure for Espionage. Hopefully it will be worth it.

- **Male Bullshit! magic meets girl bullshit! magic:** It's time to crack the mystery of male and female AE users. **FOR SCIENCE!** (`800` RU)   
After a few weeks of study, careful to keep your subjects alive, you think you at least have the basics of human AE manipulation solved. From what you can tell so far, the human body is a kind of... incubator for Ambient Energy. Naturally small amounts of AE inside their bodies grow into large gatherings, which are constantly released into the planet. You've seen this before, but never on such a massive scale in individual humans.  
No wonder the planet isn't running dry on AE, the humans are practically, and in some cases literally, farting the stuff out.  
The Female AE Users, Witches, seems to be able to forcibly expel the AE in a number of ways, manipulating it to do what they want it to, giving them a variety of abilities. Of course, this drains the amount of AE in their bodies faster than they can replace it, so they usually seem to only have these abilities when they are very young.  
The males on the other hand, cannot use their abilities consciously, at least, not usually, and even when they can, it isn't as obvious as a Witch's abilities. Even so, used in the right situation, in times of great stress, they can be just as devastating, if not even more so, as the Battle of Berlin displayed. They become even more powerful in large groups, where they may ignore mortal wounds and destroyed limbs just to cause more harm to their enemy.  
On the bright side, you believe you know enough about the human body and mind to begin the creation of an Artificial Soul to generate, absorb, and utilize AE in combat. You've only scratched the surface of what AE can do, but already things are starting to look promising.  
**Reward:** Bonus to AE related research  
*New Unit:* `Neuroi Witch Mk II.` Utilizes AE projection to create shields and other magical powers. All current Witches upgraded to `Mk II` Status.
