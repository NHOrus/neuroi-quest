Turn 6, June 1946

Okay, this planet has officially weirded you out. First it has a huge amount of Ambient Energy, alright, that's not exactly uncommon. Then it's home to heavily armed females who use it like a child uses a toy(sometimes quite literally in their case), oh, well, that has happened before.
But now this. Now you find out that the planet's AE is being sustained indefinitely by the humans who live on it, despite the fact that previous experiments confirmed that no species would have the AE capacity to do any such thing.

You're almost looking forward to facing Cluster 302. At least they're normal.

Proposed Actions:
-The Best Defence...: You probably have the humans off balance from the fall of Venice. If you capitalize on their surprise, you might be able to for them out of Romagna entirely.
Reward: Battle of Romagna begins this turn. Humans would be unprepared and not fully reinforced.
-Girls' Day In (a giant Alien Stronghold): You've studied the biology of the humans sufficiently, but you're still not sure how they interact. Come to think of it, your captive Witches have started to become rather unstable, and have been noted to be walking around in the exact same patterns, dropping small objects on the floor repeatedly, and in some cases, going into fetal positions on the floor. Perhaps you could let them interact with each other, while under very, VERY, heavy guard?
Reward: Captive Witches' psyche somewhat healed, understanding of human social behaviour, bonus to Human-Neuroi Hybrid, not being a jerk to a bunch of teenage girls
-You're going that-away, I'm going this-away: The humans obviously expect you to fight them in Romagna. Launching an attack somewhere else, like say, Ostmark and the Balkans, would be an excellent way to catch them off guard, especially since many of their soldiers are now on the Italian Peninsula.
Reward: Launch Invasion of Ostmark Special Action
-We're all alien invaders here.: Despite having fought with them for some time, you have to admit, you don't know your comrades very well. Perhaps you should try to fix that.
Reward: Relations with other Hives improve
-Spreading the Faith: Maybe there's something to this whole, Religion thing. From what you can tell, another way to earn favour is to build huge, expensive, and rather useless structures of worship to the deities you wish to venerate. Another way is to kill anyone not following your religion until they agree to, but the Neuroi have been doing that for a while now.
Reward: DIce God Faith Spreads, ???, GM and Dice Gods are Amused.
-Last one to the Library wears the Pants!: You're really not sure what the humans themselves know about AE Manipulation, or Magic, as they call it. There were several Witch strongholds, covens, and old libraries in Romagna that had to be abandoned when you invaded. Perhaps there is something in them worth looking at?
Reward: More information on AE Manipulation, Get to tell the Witches: "I'm in ur base, readin ur B00Kz!"
-Write In:
Rewards: ???

-To go boldly where pretty much every other Neuroi has gone before!: Viable space craft just moved waaaay up on your priority list.
-Maus Trap: Figure out what you can about these Super-Heavy Tanks, they nearly cost you the battle of Berlin.
-Brain Invaders: Your Infiltrator Bugs are good for spying, but not much else, maybe you could modify them to take control of unsuspecting humans, giving them many more options.
-Don't Dig too Deep!: Tunnelling has proven itself to be effective before. Perhaps the creation of dedicated tunnellers would allow you to use such things more often.
-AE Adaptation: Your conventional units could do with some upgrading. Perhaps the best option would be to modify them with AE. You could boost their capabilities by a great deal, especially with your new discoveries on AE.
-No System is Safe!: With another Cluster coming in, some upgrades to your Electronic Warfare capabilities couldn't go amiss.
-Write in: You can research anything. ANYTHING. Including Magic.
