It is `January, 1946`. For six years humanity has battled against the alien invaders known as the `Neuroi`. Where conventional weapons fail, the greatest successes are guaranteed by the `Witches`, young, magic using girls in `Strikers`. The most famous of the witches, the members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, have won another victory over the Neuroi in Gallia.

This is not their story.

You are the consciousness that commands a Neuroi Hive upon this planet. The orders were simply to harvest the needed energy and resources.
Things have not gone according to plan.

A certain human Energy Manipulator, human designation Yoshika Miyafuji, destroyed the Super-Hive, and ever since then, our forces have been beaten back by the humans, lacking the resources needed to campaign effectively.

Furthermore, Yoshika Miyafuji is reported to have regained her ability to use Ambient Energy, despite having lost it previously.
This is... unacceptable. The operation must succeed. You are in command of one of the three remaining Hives on this planet. Victory here means wealth and power. Failure ends in simple annihilation.
Good luck.


Hive Choices:

[] **Berlin**: One of the first Hives to be deployed on Earth, now uncomfortably close to the front lines as enemies in all directions plan its destruction. It has an additional objective: Acquire Yoshika Miyafuji, to research her ability to regain Ambient Energy Usage.
-*Pros*: Research Budget: Neuroi Hives must preserve some of their resources for shipment back home. However, the importance of studying Ambient Energy Usage means the Berlin Hive has a larger "Budget" to do things with. Additionally, you gain a bonus to research.
-*Cons*: Little Girls, Big Guns: Karlsland reeeeaally wants its homeland back. Since Karlsland is moving quite ahead in military technology, especially Strikers, you can expect lots of witches coming at you, including the 501st itself, and if you want to complete your objective, you're going to be fighting them.

[] **Vladivastok**: Former home of the Orussian Pacific Fleet, now home to the Neuroi. Aside from that, there's not much special about it, aside from Orussia wanting its port back. It's been under Neuroi control for some time now though, and they've made sure that there's nowhere nearby the humans can feel safe.
-*Pros*: This is My Town: The Neuroi have fortified the region like nothing else. From entrenched laser batteries to mines, the place is about as well-protected as it gets. Also, human forces lack any nearby havens to resupply, meaning they'll be operating on a very long supply train.
-*Cons*: The Neuroi don't have a Navy: If they haven't been modified extensively, Neuroi do very poorly in the water. Sadly, Vladivastok is a port, so you'll be seeing a lot of it. And a lot of humanity's Pacific Navies.

[] **Suez**: Entryway into the Suez Canal. It's been under Neuroi control for some time, and humanity wants it back. Against them is what has been the most powerful of the Neuroi forces since the beginning of the war.
-*Pros*: Badass Army: The Suez Hive is home to the most powerful Neuroi military forces on Earth.
-*Cons*: We want our Canal back: The Karlslanders want the Berlin Hive gone, the Orussians want Vladivastok back. Unfortunately for you, everyone on Earth can agree on the value of retaking the Suez Canal. You can expect a great deal of humanity's military to be hurled at you, very quickly.


[] **Atlantic Hive**: There is no Atlantic Hive. It definitely hasn't been underwater since this war began, waiting and building in case it was needed. It is absolutely not the home of the Neuroi that have been modified to fight underwater.
-*Pros*: What Do You MEAN They Have A Navy!?: This Hive is home to the Neuroi Underwater Fleet. Seeing as the Allies have no idea the Neuroi even have a presence underwater, this Hive is likely to catch them by surprise. It's also very well hidden, being underwater.
-*Cons*: A Navy isn't cheap: Navies cost a lot, and this one is no exception. You also won't get as much in the way of resources, since Ambient Energy usually doesn't gather underwater. If you want to expand your forces quickly, you'll need to do some raiding.
