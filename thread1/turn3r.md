###Actions

- **Production:** `5,080 RU`  
  0. 40 Infantry Bot Divisions `400 RU`
  0. 20 Anti-Vehicle Bots Divisions `200 RU`
  0. 30 Neuroi Walker Groups `750 RU`

You pump out more units like there's no tomorrow, and there probably won't be if the humans win. Hundreds of thousands of Bots, a couple thousand Walkers, thousands of flyers, are almost 30 Neuroi Witches are churned out in a month, exhausting most of your resource stockpile. It'll be worth it if you survive though.

- **Ain't that a Dam Shame?:** With the Baltic Fleet gone, the humans will need to come over the Rhine to attack you. Maybe you could make it significantly harder? `500 RU`  
**Rewards:** Human difficulty crossing Rhine increased. Invasion possibly delayed further.  
This goes perfectly. You quickly and subtly create several artificial dams, building up the water levels to critical levels. When the first human soldiers begin moving across the Rhine in boats, the Dams burst open, along with the human ones, sending torrents of water across the riverbanks, drowning a couple thousand humans. The high speed rapids have bought you another two weeks.

###Research Actions:
- **Anti-Witch Weapons:** You've already ruled out nets, glue, and grapples, maybe there's something else you can use? `1000 RU`  
Glue Guns don't work in high speed combat, Electric weapons tend to do more damage to the Neuroi, and the less said about the Microwaves the better. Finally, you discover the power of Sonic Weaponry. Witch shields don't block sound, so these weapons should be perfect. Larger versions are being mounted on some of your fixed fortifications. While it can only be mounted on your Large and Ultra Heavy units, you now have large numbers of forces that can hold their own against Witches.  
**Reward:** Large and Ultra Heavy effectiveness against Witches slightly increased. Fortifications now include Sonic Emitters.

- **Dedicated Production Lines:** Why are we using time and actions on building units that could be better used elsewhere? 500 RU  
You set up a nice assembly line across your territory. This means you won't have to divert large amounts of your attention to creating units, when it could better be spent elsewhere.  
**Reward:** Producing units no longer takes up an action slot.

- **Homing Lasers Part II:** Perhaps more refinement to your lasers will give you a bit more of an edge over humans? Being able to shoot down Witches or incoming ordnance would be nice. `1000 RU`  
You work like a savant on this, and it shows. Your new lasers twist, curve, dance, and will persistently follow Witches even with their fancy dodging. This has also improved the accuracy of all your lasers, and it gives you some ideas.  
**Reward:** All Units have increased accuracy. Laser Artillery Unlocked.

- **I have MANY lasers to spare!:** Now that you've got advanced homing lasers, you might be able to trade the schematics to the other Hives in exchange for, well, a lot of things. They might even be willing to send military assistance.  
You send out your second generation Lasers to Vladivastok and Suez, while sending the first generation to Atlantic.  
*Vladivastok* is very happy, and, while it can't spare any forces, gives you a great deal of information on how to make defenses, which you quickly put to work.  
*Suez* is much closer, and soon human comm channels are surprised when a sudden push from the Suez Hive takes them all the way to the northern coast of Egypt, with their new, more accurate lasers. Several transports under heavy escort shove their way into Karlsland, deploying large amounts of reinforcements for the coming battle, including two legendary Land Battleships.  
*Atlantic* stays silent, but reports say that several Allied convoys carrying vital supplies and soldiers were lost at sea, with no one having any idea what happened to them.   
**Reward:** Automatically completed research on Mines, Torpedoes, and Improved fortifications.  
*Reinforcements from Suez:* 2 Land Battleships, 5 Ultra Heavy Groups, 25 Walker Groups, 50 Infantry Bot Groups, 25 Anti-Vehicle Infantry Bot Groups  
*Atlantic Hive* does something for a change.  
*Suez* Hive Conquers Egypt!


- **Human Biology**  
You send out a series of quick raids across human territory and capture a couple hundred of them. Unfortunately, due to an accident when testing for anti-witch weapons, all you discovered was that when you accidentally shoot humans with a Large Type sized lightning gun, they die!  
**Rewards:** Couple hundred dead humans, discovery that Humans don't like lightning.
