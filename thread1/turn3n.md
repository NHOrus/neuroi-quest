#Turn 3, Neuroi News

###Empire-wide news.

**Inter-Cluster Warfare!** After an inconclusive investigation, the tension between Hive Clusters `206` and `302` has erupted into all out war. Over `100` Super-Hives have engaged each other across the Border. So far the conflict is a stalemate, though rumour has it that both sides are preparing fleets to remove elements of the other's mining operations across Known Space.

**Shocking Defeat!** The 2nd Assault Cluster, consisting of over `3,000` Mega-Hives, has been almost completely wiped out in a titanic battle near the Fahrong Home Systems. While Fahrong losses appear to be even more devastating, the loss of an entire Cluster has the Empire reeling, and yet more protests are calling for an end to the war at the negotiation table.

##Human Intelligence

**The Neuroi Strike Back!** After months of being on the defensive, the Neuroi are beginning to regain the upper hand. In Afrika, forces from the Suez Hive launched a devastating attack across Egypt. Liberion General Patton was killed in action, and the human forces have been split in two.

**Remember Berlin!** The attempted invasion of Berlin has ended in disaster, with almost everyone sent out dying in battle. However, reports from the battle detail the heroic last stand of the Karlsland forces, and has become a rallying cry across Earth. Reports of male magic users in the battle have the scientific and magical communities baffled.

**In their own Track! Came the Wolfpack!** Several Allied convoys operating in the Atlantic have vanished. Fear is spreading that the Neuroi have perfected naval technology. Nations like Liberion are stepping up their coastal defenses, but unless a method to stop these unseen killers is found, it is feared that European forces will find themselves drastically short on vital supplies.

**Conflict in Asia spreads** The war that has engulfed Zhong Guo has spread to the Fusoan territory of Inchon and the Gallian colony of Dai Nam. Resistance groups appear to be fighting both the Allies and in some cases, each other. Whatever the case, Allied strength in Asia is being sapped as more and more troops must be sent to contain the uprisings.
