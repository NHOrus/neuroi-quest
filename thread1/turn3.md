#Turn 3, March 1946

The humans have begun moving their forces near the Rhine. Several small, inconclusive skirmishes have taken place, with losses easily replaced by both sides. Unless they are delayed further, the attack will likely come at the end of the month.  
At least you know how much you'll be facing, for all the pain it gives your confidence.

####Proposed Actions:
- *I have MANY lasers to spare!:* Now that you've got advanced homing lasers, you might be able to trade the schematics to the other Hives in exchange for, well, a lot of things. They might even be willing to send military assistance.  
*Reward:* Other Hives get Homing Lasers, Improved relations with all Hives, ???
- *Production:* Your current army isn't big enough. Remedy this. (Will need to submit build list)  
*Reward:* Bigger Army
- *And These Assholes:* The idea of the Atlantic Hive pricks doing some fighting and dying for a change appeals to you.  
*Reward:* Atlantic Hive Assistance (Unlikely)
- *Ain't that a Dam Shame?:* With the Baltic Fleet gone, the humans will need to come over the Rhine to attack you. Maybe you could make it significantly harder?  
*Rewards:* Human difficulty crossing Rhine increased. Invasion possibly delayed further.
- *Bloody-Fooking Paperwork:* You're not allowed to use weapons from the main Neuroi Military force, or even those being used by your Cluster's PMCs. Maybe you can change that?  
*Reward:* Less chance of incidents from high tech research. Actually get people back home to notice you for once in history.
- *Write in:* Maybe there's another way to sabotage the humans' efforts?  
*Reward:* ???

####Proposed Research Actions:
- *Neuroi water adaptation:* The Neuroi don't do well in, or above water, maybe you can change that?
- *To go boldly where pretty much every other Neuroi has gone before!:* Viable space craft are quite a bit out of your league right now, but an early start might give you an incredible advantage over the humans.
- *Anti-Witch Weapons:* You've already ruled out nets, glue, and grapples, maybe there's something else you can use?
- *Human Biology:* Now that you have a way to capture and contain humans, maybe you could study them, and how they use Ambient Energy.
- *Homing Lasers Part II:* Perhaps more refinement to your lasers will give you a bit more of an edge over humans?
- *Plasma:* As a mining group/bunch of glory hounds, you're not supposed to have Plasma weapons, but it's easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission.
- *Write in:* ???
