# Turn 2, February 1946: Results

###Actions

- **Waiter, there's an alien bug in my soup:** You've got Neuroi Bugs, now you just need to deploy them somehow. `200 RU`  
You prepare a few various flying types with the resources given, load them with Bugs, and send them out all across Europe on raids. They are, of course, destroyed, but not before they drop off hundreds of your new infiltrators in various bases across Europe. You haven't penetrated very deeply into Allied High Command yet, but you have several junior officers on constant watch, and various information coming in from overheard discussions between soldiers.  
**Reward:** Human Intelligence Unlocked, see below

- **This technically isn't grave-robbing..:** There's a lot of scrap metal left over from the damage you caused. Maybe you can salvage some? `200 RU`  
When your fliers move into the Baltic port ruins, they find them almost completely abandoned, aside from a few daring human civilians. You quickly dispose of them and begin your grave-robbing resource acquisition, and gain a healthy amount of raw materials. Unfortunately, none of the ships were in good enough condition to actually get decent scans to help with your own aquatic forces, but you've still made a profit out of this.  
**Reward:** `2380 RU`

###Research:

- **Witch Capture unit:** If you're going to be taking Yoshika Miyafuji, or any Witches, for study, you probably need a way to capture humans alive. `400 RU`  
You're able to create a stasis beam that you think can stun a Witch once her shields are weakened or gone. It would also be perfect for knocking large groups unconscious. While you make this, you also build a holding area for any humans you capture. In fact, you build such a good holding area you could probably host a small army of prisoners there, while doing any number of experiments on them, intrusive or no.  
**Reward:** Can now choose to capture humans alive. Will unlock further research options.

- **Infantry AT:** Humans tend to use Bazookas or rocket launchers to destroy Neuroi on foot. Perhaps you could do something similar for your Infantry Bots? `200 RU`  
Technically you're not supposed to have Anti-Armour weapons on infantry, but with the situation you're in, you doubt anyone who gives a shit about you(which is to say, pretty much no one) would object. you're able to modify some infantry bots to carry a heavy, shoulder mounted laser cannon, perfect for melting through vehicle armour. It's slow-firing and short-ranged, and doesn't hold a candle to what real Neuroi military weapons are like, but it's good enough for primitive human armour.  
**Reward:** *Anti-Vehicle Bots Division Unlocked:* Very Strong vs Light Vehicles, Strong vs Tanks, weak vs Infantry, Short ranged) (Costs `10 RU`) 5 Infantry Bot divisions converted to Anti-Vehicle Bots.

- **Write in: Neuroi Nets/Glue:** Witch shields tend to block laser bursts, what if a charged net, grappling Neuroi or sticky substance can be deployed instead to entangle them?  
This has potential. This has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, grapples and nets are both negatives from what you've been able to tell. Further research will be needed to get this done.
