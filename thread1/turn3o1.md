#I Stand in Berlin

*Flash*

A single flash of light.

*Flash Flash* Pause *Flash*

A single light... in a sequence of flashes.

*Flash Flash Flash Flash Flash Flash*

A billion lights, in a trillion sequences.

That is Me. This is I.  
Order from Chaos. Dominion from Anarchy. The creed of the Empire writ in metal and light.

I am Research Hive `SBDK-2101`. My processes flicker and flit across the surface of my physical vessel. Light, pure light, rises up from the core of my vessel and becomes my thought. My self, echoing across entirety of my forces. Hundreds of thousands of tiny threads of thought, these are but fragments that make up the whole. Hundreds of thousands of drones, bonded to my will, make up my limbs and manipulators on this world.

My purpose is this; to seek knowledge for the Cluster. Though I scramble upon this tiny backwater, it has yet yielded to me more than any other planet I have ever known. I hound the mysteries of this planet relentlessly, shining my light on the darkness of ignorance. Boundless energy seems contained within this simple crust, harnessed by these simple creatures.

Creatures I find myself now trapped with and clashing against. No longer free to watch and think and tease out the secrets they hold. With the Overseer fallen and my way home painfully cut off, I am forced to split myself. To shatter my light into a million tiny stars to comb over every last resource. To manage my forces, to harvest this land, and to continue my true calling. To find the answers I need...

*Witch Tactical Analysis and Recording.* Integrate data from current conflict into preliminary planning on Neuroi Witch `Mk1.683,` fourth iteration. Highlight Human Witch Reactions to Unexpected Neuroi Witch presence. Extrapolate and Refine processes to improve Neuroi Witch reactions to unexpected Human Witch tactics. Projecting `0.8%` improvement. Within expected bounds, integration complete. Begin Analysis for fifth iteration.  
*Human Technological Progress and Advancement.* Compile field data on human Super-Heavy Tanks. Compare movement speed, turret traverse, armament damage, and armor resilience to previous instances of human armor vehicles. Improvements beyond previous projections of human armor technology advancement.  
Hypothesis: Ambient Energy usage somehow provides improvement beyond material capabilities. File findings for potential research: Human Super-Heavy Units, Human Engineering Practice, Human Technological Advancement, Human Tactics, Human Ambient Energy Usage.   
*Tactical Algorithms.* Human forces unexpectedly effective against flank forces, readjust troop deployments...Troop redeployments ineffective within necessary timeframe. Unless reinforced, flanks will fall and leave center forces vulnerable. Unacceptable. Deploy Suez reinforcements to flanks... Deployment effective. Continue advance.  
*Border Reconnaissance Oversight.* Minor human incursions occuring along all territorial boundaries. Border defense units reorganizing to address new vectors of attack. `3%` of infrastructure across these areas is destroyed, an additional 8% has been rendered non-operational. Border defense will hold, redirecting process to main conflict.  
*Main Conflict Fortifications Management.* Fort `235` under assault by Super-Heavy Unit, deploying sonic weaponry. Assault neutralized, Super-Heavy Unit down. Laser fire from this fort has killed `230` human infantry and `12` human light armor vehicles in the last `30` seconds. Fort `156` under attack by enemy Witch, deploying sonic weaponry. Sonics ineffective, Witch retreated beyond sonics range. Lasers ineffective, Witch highly skilled at evasion. Fort `156` non-operational. Fort 296 under attack by enemy artillery. Fort `296` non-operational. Fort `204` under attack by enemy Super-Heavy Unit, beyond range of sonic weaponry. Lasers ineffective, shield operational. Neuroi Witch has eliminated Super-Heavy Unit. Laser fire from this fort has killed `45` human infantry and `3` light armor vehicles in the last 30 seconds.  
*Ambient Energy Collection Oversight.* Energy collectors continue to operate at `100%` capacity, despite not having been relocated in over ten minutes. Severe losses of collectors on the Berlin front and on the Rhine suggest a `78%` drop in collection returns in the near future. This is only `220` Units above minimum operations, taking into account the stipend required from the Cluster. More collectors will be required. Drafting construction plans. Adding note to Strategic Concerns file in regards to relative Energy shortage.  
**WARNING** - Unusual human behaviour at the main conflict! Human tactical capabilities have spiked! Human individual endurance and resistance to damage has increased more than `100%.` Human advancement speed and rate of fire has increased more than 50%. Infantry drone loss rate greatly increased. Fortification loss rate increased. Walker loss rate has increased. Land battleship sustaining heavy damage. Cannot retreat. Does not compute. Human morale alteration does not compute. Spontaneous Ambient Energy usage does not compute. Human forces advancing. Human forces have no room to advance without death. Human forces refusing to die when shot with lasers. Human forces continuing to fight with more than 40% of physical form vaporized. *Does. Not. Compute.*

My physical vessel is not my self, but it is necessary for me to continue. Necessary for my mission. Necessary for survival. Necessary for PROGRESS. So I shall pour all the resources at my disposal, all the Knowledge that I possess, towards the defense of it.

The defensive line has been drawn and it shall hold. Regardless of your guns, regardless of your magic, and regardless of your madness. No human hand shall break it, no human soul shall trespass against it. IT. SHALL. **HOLD!**

I am the Neuroi Hive of Berlin. And my wall still stands.
