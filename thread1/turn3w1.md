#Turn 3, March 1946, War

##Battle For Karlsland: Rhine

The human invasion starts off with the largest barrage of artillery you've ever seen. 5,500 guns light up the night, raining countless tons of ordinance on positions across the Rhine River in a barrage that goes on for hours. In the air the Allied bombers escorted by Witches and fighters move out to bomb any areas that were intact. Other fighters loaded with rockets and bombs launch attack runs on fortifications, loosing endless volleys on your forces in the initial hours of the attack. You even see hundreds of human transport planes taking off to unknown destinations.

Of course, your own forces respond with equal ferocity. Lasers lance out from emplacements in every position across the Rhine, bringing down planes in the dozens, while your own fliers take to the air against the humans, but there are simply too many of them, and too few of your own fliers nearby. The human Flak 88 and other AA guns open fire as well, downing even more of your fliers. You still have spare Small Types and a few Large Types, but you can only send them after one target, with the amount of human fliers in the air.

*You decide to:*

- **[ ]** Have them attack the bombers. They'll wreck havoc on your fortifications and Ultra-Heavies if they remain intact
- **[X]** Target the large flights of human transports. They'll be dropping paratroopers all across Karlsland. Well-equipped, and surprisingly deadly paratroopers.
- **[ ]** Send them against the human Fighters, the less of those the humans have, the better off your air forces will be.

---
The artillery barrage refuses to slack, and soon endless waves of assault boats carrying infantry are launched across the river, with your positions at least partially suppressed by the artillery. You can even see strange floatation devices that are allowing tanks to move across the river with surprising speed. You can even see a couple of heavily escorted Super-Heavy Tanks. Facing them are your well entrenched Infantry Bots and several hundred Walkers, all dug in and supported with powerful automated emplacements, though sadly, no Sonic ones.  
You still have your Medium Types ready to be deployed, but *what do you send them against?*

- **[ ]** Target the artillery, silence as many guns as possible, and your ground forces can handle the landing parties
- **[X]** Kill the AA guns, they're the biggest threat to your aircraft (Witches notwithstanding).
- **[ ]** Target the Assault Boats, they're sitting ducks at the moment.

---
With the sheer amount of fire-power present, it's unlikely you can hold onto the Rhine, though it may be possible, with the humans forced to ford or boat their way across. While your Ultra-Heavies won't be able to assist, you could try sending in the rest your Large Types and Witches to hold the line.

- **[ ]** Hold the Line at the Rhine, send in everything we have there, and we can stop them from deploying their Super-Heavies and even setting foot into Karlsland, though your heavier ground units will be unavailable, plus, you can take advantage of the soggy terrain of the recently-flooded Rhine.
- **[X]** Pull back after the first couple of waves, there's too much fire-power against too few of your forces. You can extend their supply lines and send them against your heaviest units and fortifications if you pull back.

"Where's our AA cover!?"  
"My left wing's gone!"  
"When the hell did lasers BEND!?"  
"FUCK! FUCK! FUUUUUCK!"  

All of these are common statements coming from the human fighter pilots. Faced with new homing lasers and lacking any meaningful numbers advantage, they are being shot down with ease, losing almost half their number for a much smaller loss of Neuroi.  
**Human Losses:** `900 Fighters`  
**Neuroi Losses:** `12` Small Type Flyer Groups

---
With the human fighters very busy, both your reserves and your Medium Types are able to make their moves without interruption.  
The human transports are defenceless against your fliers, and their escorts are too few. They seem to realize how pointless continuing is. Some try to air-drop their passengers early, others turn and try to make for the safety of the Allied lines. It's a massacre. Hundreds of transports are sliced into pieces by mass laser fire, depositing flaming wreckage across the banks of the Rhine. Famous airborne units like the Liberion 82nd and 101st Airborne, Britannian 1st Airborne Regiment, and the legendary Karlsland Parachute Armies are wiped out in seconds.  
**Human Losses:** `70,000` Paratroopers, `200` Fighters  
**Neuroi Losses:** `2` Small Type Flyer Groups

---
Attacking the AA guns goes less well, however. The sheer number of them keeps your Medium types heavily occupied, and by the time they do enough damage, they've taken significant losses themselves. However, at least the murderous AA fire has slackened, somewhat.  
**Human Losses:** `600` AA Guns  
**Neuroi Losses:** `5` Medium Type Flyer Groups  

---
Then the bombers come in. AA Emplacements send red beams of light into the air, tearing through dozens of them, but even more come through, even as the forces you sent to deal with the transports attack as well. Thousands of bombs rain on your fortifications, destroying emplacements, Bots, and Walkers alike, severely damaging your defences across the Rhine.  
**Human Losses:** 250 Bombers  
**Neuroi Losses:** 8 Infantry Bot Divisions, 4 Anti-Vehicle Bot Divisions, 5 Walker Groups, 35% of Rhine River Emplacements Destroyed.

###Human Assault Boat
###Private Nichols

You're sweating, pale, nearly puking riding in this piece-of-shit boat floating down a river that's doing its damn best to upturn the whole thing and let everyone onboard drown. You see a laser streak and hear an explosion signalling the destruction of a nearby boat. You can't help but wonder why you're even here. Oh yeah, that's right, because command decided that they could afford to lose you and your whole damn division more than they'd like to lose their precious new tanks and fancy pant-less princesses.

Fucking Witches. Bet they wouldn't be caught dead in one of these things about to land and charge head first into the Neuroi guns. Your boats almost at shore and the fire intensifies. Not only are the heavy guns blazing now, but the lighter infantry bots are starting to open fire to. Several men in your own boat scream as lasers incinerate them. Finally you reach land, and everyone, you included rushes off screaming, climbing over the bodies of dead comrades to finally fight back.

You're close enough to see the Neuroi Emplacements firing. There are dozens of burnt out husks and disintegrating wrecks, but even more are sending out murderous volleys of fire, killing you friends and annihilating more boats as they try to land, disgorging thousands of Liberion soldiers.

A nearby Sherman goes up in smoke and you go prone and stare at the towering Neuroi Walker. It's lower Laser cannon sweeps over the bank of the River, and you hear dozens of agonized screams. A shell blasts into the hull. It turns and vaporizes the offending tank, but leaves itself open for the other three to destroy its core.

You hear one of the sergeants yelling. "Come on boys! Over the top, Go Go Go!"

Somehow, despite all the noise, flashing lights, and screams, you pick yourself off the ground and advance, rifle firing at the nearest bot as everyone else does the same.
To stay is to die, to advance is to die. But at least advancing, you have a chance to hurt them back for killing you.

---
The humans land and hurl themselves at you in waves. Thousands of infantry and dozens of tanks are destroyed, but more come on, heedless of losses, desperate to secure the bank of the Rhine. You bring down the first attack, then the second, then prepare to retreat.

Except you can't. The bombers damaged your Emplacements too greatly for that, and there is no end to the humans, no lull in which you can withdraw. Each time you kill one, another charges forward, taking its place before you can target the next one. There is no time to retreat, no time to reorganize, all your ground forces can do is open fire and do as much damage as possible before being destroyed in turn. You are pushed back, meter by bloody meter, the boggy ground covered with corpses and wreckage, yet more humans charge forward, screaming and firing. Your ground forces fight until they have been totally annihilated. In the air, the witches devastate your aerial units.

The Rhine is humanity's. The blood-soaked Rhine is humanity's.
