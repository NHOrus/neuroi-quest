#Turn 4, April 1946

You are not panicking. No, you just defeated the humans(barely) and have all your territory back. You're certainly not worried about how they have utterly wrecked your infrastructure no, or that they can apparently turn into magical insane berserkers.  
And you're DEFINITELY not panicking over the war that's going on back home, and that you just got a giant target on your head that says: "Shoot me!"  
Nope, not panicking at all.

####Proposed Actions:
- *4 AIs walk into a conference room...:* Since the Super-Hive fell, and quite a bit before that, it's been every Hive for itself. With only for left, you really can't afford that anymore.  
*Rewards:* Increased Cooperation between all the Hives
- *Counterattack:* With the humans in retreat, you have the opportunity to go on the offensive again. With your industry badly damaged, you might need it.  
*Reward:* Special Action: Invasion Unlocked
- *Fortifications,* new and improved: The invasion destroyed pretty much all the fortifications you had, maybe you should built new ones, with the data Vladivastok has given you.
Cost: `1000`, `2000`, or `4000` RU  
*Reward:* Better Fortifications
- *Bloody REALLY FOOKING IMPORTANT Paperwork:* Considering the war that's broken out, you really need better weapons. You might not even need to bribe the people back home now!  
*Rewards:* Permission for higher tech equipment
- *Technology Trade:* Who knows what you could get from the other Hives with your new tech? (Must specify tech given)  
*Rewards:* Other Hives get new tech, ???
- *Write In:*  
*Rewards:* ???

###Research Actions:

- []

- *Laser Artillery:* After the supreme ass-kicking you got at the hands of human artillery, it might be good to make some of your own.
- *Neuroi water adaptation:* The Neuroi don't do well in, or above water, maybe you can change that?
- *Plasma:* Surely with the war going on, the rest of the Cluster will allow you to defend yourself?
- *To go boldly where pretty much every other Neuroi has gone before!:* Viable space craft just moved waaaay up on your priority list.
- *What the fuck:* What the hell happened out there? Why didn't the humans break, how come that suicidal mass charge wasn't blasted apart by your fire power, why could they use Ambient Energy, HOW DID ONE OFFICER MAKE HIS VOICE REACH ACROSS THE ENTIRE BATTLEFIELD!?!?
- *Witch studies:* You've got Witches captive. Not Yoshika Miyafuji, but still Witches. You might as well study them and see what you can learn.
- *Communication?:* You've been fighting against the humans for decades now. Still, if it's a choice between humans or Cluster 302, you'd take the humans any day. But if you want an alliance, or even a ceasefire, you'll need to find a way to speak to them first.
- *Maus Trap:* Figure out what you can about these Super-Heavy Tanks, they nearly cost you the battle.
- *Write In:* What else can you think about doing?
