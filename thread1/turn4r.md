#Turn 4, April 1946, Results

## Plan Tack into the Wind

### Build order:
- `89` Infantry Bot Divisions (`10` RU each)
- `37` Anti-Vehicle Bot Divisions (`10` RU each)
- `38` Neuroi Walker Groups (`25` RU each)
- `29` Small Type Flyer Groups (`20` RU each)
- `25` Medium Type Groups (`30` RU each)
- `9` Large Type Groups (`50` RU each)
- `8` Ultra-Heavy Groups (`100` RU each)
- `3` Neuroi Witch `Mark 1` Groups (`300` RU each)

Once again, an army emerges from production facilities across Karlsland. Hopefully it will last longer than the previous one.

###Actions

- **4 AIs walk into a conference room...:** Since the Super-Hive fell, and quite a bit before that, it's been every Hive for itself. With only four left, you really can't afford that anymore.  
Everyone's heard about the `206`/`302` war, and none of your comrades are particularly eager to die. Unfortunately, they're a bit busy at the moment with their own projects, and won't be available until next month. Still, at least you'll be there next month.  
**Reward:** Neuroi Conference next turn

- **Counterattack:** With the humans in retreat, you have the opportunity to go on the offensive again. With your industry badly damaged, you might need it.  
See **`Special Action`** Below

- **Communication?:** (`1,000` RU)  
By observing the human witches, studying history banks and data from your Bugs, you believe you can send out radio transmissions to the humans. However, studies indicate that they might be most responsive to an actual, human-looking being that communicates with them. You think you might know how to ensure that said creature can talk in non-robotic and suitably human fashion, but more research is needed before it can be produced.  
**Reward:** Radio Communication, Bonus to Neuroi/Human Hybrid units Research

- **What the fuck:** (`1,000` RU committed to bonus, this is CRITICAL)  
Almost before the battle is finished, you send out units to secure the dead humans for studies of their sudden berserker mode.  
Turns out some of the dead humans weren't quite as dead as you thought they were. You suppose you should have realized this before they got up again and tore several of your bots to pieces. Fortunately, your extensive preparations ensured that they didn't do too much damage. Studies of the corpses show that their bodies seemed to... leech energy out of the ground, which was then manipulated in a variety of ways, sometimes allowing bodies to function long after the actual organs required for survival were destroyed. Sadly, with half of your lab in pieces, you can't study much more.  
**Rewards:** Rudimentary knowledge on Male AE users, Bonus to further AE studies

- **Witch studies:** (`1,000` RU Committed to Bonus, this is also quite important!)   
This goes less terribly than studying male berserkers. You've currently got them in cells that deposit nutrient paste and water every so often, so they won't die of malnutrition or dehydration. Occasionally they try to break out by using magic, to no effect. You learn a bit about how their bodies manipulate AE, but not much else. Perhaps a different method of study is needed. At least you have notes to compare.  
**Rewards:** Rudimentary knowledge of Witches, Bonus to further Witch Studies

###Special Action: Invasion
It appear that the humans have decided to abandon the rest of Karlsland, rather than try to face you there with their weakened forces. You now control the entirety of the nation of Karlsland. However, you are still surrounded by humans, and your industry is crippled. It would be best to launch an invasion somewhere, to weaken the humans and gain new territory to mine. You have several *options.*

- **Baltland**  
*Pros:* Defenses have been crippled by your previous attack upon the fleet and its port infrastructure.  
*Cons:* It's large coast means you'll be in the water often, and might have to deal with the Britannian and Gallian Navies along the northern coast. Would have to rely on Air Units to gain a foothold.

- **Gallia**, **Belgica**, and the **Lower Countries**  
*Pros:* Massive territorial gains mean that you'll have plenty of RU should this succeed.  
*Cons:* After the Neuroi were driven out before, Gallia became the staging point for the Allies, and the most well-manned and defended human territory in Europe. You'll be running headfirst into a nightmare of defences, far more advanced than they were when Gallia fell before. You may even have to deal with other new weapon Karlsland made to retake its homeland. Very, very risky with current forces.

- **Ostmark**  
*Pros:* It was recently taken by the humans, and after Suez's air force barrelled through it, it is likely poorly defended.  
*Cons:* Expanding east could easily provoke Orussia, sending you into a two front war. Also, its close ties to Karlsland mean you might face who-knows-what.

- **Venezia** and **Romagna**  
*Pros:* Would help you link up with the Suez Hive  
*Cons:* The nations on the Italian Peninsula didn't contribute large amounts of forces to any of the nearby campaigns, meaning their military forces are still intact. Would have to rely on air units to gain a foothold.
