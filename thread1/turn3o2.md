#Memoirs of a Witch.

When we were assigned to our squadrons, there were a lot of ways the conventional soldiers took to having a witch among them.  
Some scoffed at us, saying that people like us were not supposed to be in war. Others were kinder, and accepted us, which inevitably lead to those witches becoming mascots of their units. While other witches were looked at neutrally, just another way to try and combat the Neuroi.

But, for the many different ways a witch could be inducted into their unit, every witch who's survived the war long enough will go through the same thing eventually.

Eventually, a witch will take part in a battle they cannot win.

Pushed to the brink, people dying in droves to merciless lasers. A witch has been one of the few ways humanity has found that can combat the Neuroi. And as such, regardless of how we were initially treated, we are **Saved...** Soldiers throwing themselves into the fray to buy us more time, more space, paying for our continued existence with their lives so that we may fight another day. Because we are **Important.**

So witches continue, even as we leave behind scores of dead soldiers. Always keeping in mind that we have to keep **living**, keep **fighting**, all so that their sacrifices aren't in vain...

And as I watch the video of Berlin, I can't help but feel my belief crumble to so many ashes as the day is nearly won not by the witches we sacrifice to keep alive, but by the soldiers we sacrifice...

___Ha... How in the hell are our lives are more important?!___
