#Turn 3, March 1946, War

##Battle For Karlsland

The human invasion starts off with the largest barrage of artillery you've ever seen. 5,500 guns light up the night, raining countless tons of ordinance on positions across the Rhine River in a barrage that goes on for hours. In the air the Allied bombers escorted by Witches and fighters move out to bomb any areas that were intact. Other fighters loaded with rockets and bombs launch attack runs on fortifications, loosing endless volleys on your forces in the initial hours of the attack. You even see hundreds of human transport planes taking off to unknown destinations.

Of course, your own forces respond with equal ferocity. Lasers lance out from emplacements in every position across the Rhine, bringing down planes in the dozens, while your own fliers take to the air against the humans, but there are simply too many of them, and too few of your own fliers nearby. The human Flak 88 and other AA guns open fire as well, downing even more of your fliers. You still have spare Small Types and a few Large Types, but you can only send them after one target, with the amount of human fliers in the air.

*You decide to:*

- **[ ]** Have them attack the bombers. They'll wreck havoc on your fortifications and Ultra-Heavies if they remain intact
- **[ ]** Target the large flights of human transports. They'll be dropping paratroopers all across Karlsland. Well-equipped, and surprisingly deadly paratroopers.
- **[ ]** Send them against the human Fighters, the less of those the humans have, the better off your air forces will be.

The artillery barrage refuses to slack, and soon endless waves of assault boats carrying infantry are launched across the river, with your positions at least partially suppressed by the artillery. You can even see strange floatation devices that are allowing tanks to move across the river with surprising speed. You can even see a couple of heavily escorted Super-Heavy Tanks. Facing them are your well entrenched Infantry Bots and several hundred Walkers, all dug in and supported with powerful automated emplacements, though sadly, no Sonic ones.  
You still have your Medium Types ready to be deployed, but *what do you send them against?*

- **[ ]** Target the artillery, silence as many guns as possible, and your ground forces can handle the landing parties
- **[ ]** Kill the AA guns, they're the biggest threat to your aircraft (Witches notwithstanding).
- **[ ]** Target the Assault Boats, they're sitting ducks at the moment.

With the sheer amount of fire-power present, it's unlikely you can hold onto the Rhine, though it may be possible, with the humans forced to ford or boat their way across. While your Ultra-Heavies won't be able to assist, you could try sending in the rest your Large Types and Witches to hold the line.

- **[ ]** Hold the Line at the Rhine, send in everything we have there, and we can stop them from deploying their Super-Heavies and even setting foot into Karlsland, though your heavier ground units will be unavailable, plus, you can take advantage of the soggy terrain of the recently-flooded Rhine.
- **[ ]** Pull back after the first couple of waves, there's too much fire-power against too few of your forces. You can extend their supply lines and send them against your heaviest units and fortifications if you pull back.
