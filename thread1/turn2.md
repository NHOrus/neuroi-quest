#Turn 2, February 1946

Things look significantly better than they did a month ago. The human Baltic Fleet is in ruins, and what's left of it is legging it to some port a very long distance away from you. But, despite your victory, this is no time to relax, you've got an invasion to prepare against, and political shenanigans at home with `HC 302.`


####Resources (RU): `6,000`
####Income: 1,000 per turn

###Actions:

####Proposed Actions:
- *Waiter, there's an alien bug in my soup:* You've got Neuroi Bugs, now you just need to deploy them somehow.  
*Reward:* Human Intelligence
- *I have MANY lasers to spare!:** Now that you've got advanced homing lasers, you might be able to trade the schematics to the other Hives in exchange for, well, a lot of things.  
*Reward:* Other Hives get Homing Lasers, Improved relations with all Hives, ???
- *Production:* Your current army isn't big enough. Remedy this. (Will need to submit build list)  
*Reward:* Bigger Army
- *And These Assholes:* The idea of the Atlantic Hive pricks doing some fighting and dying for a change appeals to you.  
*Reward:* Atlantic Hive Assistance (Unlikely)
- *Ain't that a Dam Shame?:* With the Baltic Fleet gone, the humans will need to come over the Rhine to attack you. Maybe you could make it significantly harder?  
*Rewards:* Human difficulty crossing Rhine increased. Invasion possibly delayed further.
- *This technically isn't grave-robbing..:* There's a lot of scrap metal left over from the damage you caused. Maybe you can salvage some?  
*Rewards:* Large amount of RU.

####Proposed Research Actions:
- *Witch Capture unit:* If you're going to be taking Yoshika Miyafuji, or any Witches, for study, you probably need a way to capture humans alive.
- *Neuroi water adaptation:* The Neuroi don't do well in, or above water, maybe you can change that?
- *To go boldly where pretty much every other Neuroi has gone before!:* Viable space craft are quite a bit out of your league right now, but an early start might give you an incredible advantage over the humans.
- *Infantry AT:* Humans tend to use Bazookas or rocket launchers to destroy Neuroi on foot. Perhaps you could do something similar for your Infantry Bots?
- *Write in:* Any idea you have, put it here.
