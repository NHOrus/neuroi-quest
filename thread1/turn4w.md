[X] Venezia and Romagna
-Pros: Would help you link up with the Suez Hive
-Cons: The nations on the Italian Peninsula didn't contribute large amounts of forces to any of the nearby campaigns, meaning their military forces are still intact. Would have to rely on air units to gain a foothold.

You consider your choices. Going to Gallia or Ostmark with your forces is out. Gallia is too well fortified, and Ostmark could call for Orussia. That leaves Baltland on one hand, Romagna and Venezia on the other.
Going to Baltland is tempting. After all, you did just devastate their entire military a couple months ago. However, The Italian Peninsula calls you more. You owe Suez a favour, and it's time to pay it back.

First though, you need a foot hold on the other side of the Alps. The small, independent confederacy of Helvetica will do nicely. Your forces advance swiftly through the mountainous country, smashing aside most resistance. However, you still sustained casualties, particularly among the Infantry Bots and Small Type Flyers.
Lost 9 Infantry Bot Divisions, 2 Anti-Vehicle Bot Divisions, 1 Walker Group, 6 Small Type Flyer Groups, and 2 Medium Type Flyer Groups

Still, Helvetica is yours now, and you have a direct line of attack on Romagna.
Unfortunately, if you want to take Romagna, your first obstacle is the Alpine Wall. Countless fortified sights, built into the mountainsides, and in many other cases, they are filled with AA guns, with air bases nearby ready to launch hundreds of fighters and bombers to oppose any invasion. As the war continued, the Wall was only reinforced further.

A ground assault will be a nightmare. Your heaviest units unable to move along the mountain passes, and your lighter ones vulnerable to the volume of fire you will be exposed to. If you want to punch through, you'll need to use your aerial units to clear a landing zone for your bigger transports on the other side of the Alps.

There are multiple areas of importance where you will face the most resistance, and would be best to neutralize these points while clearing a landing zone.

Genoa: Home of the Romagnan fleet. They have multiple battleships and other ships ready to deliver long range firepower anywhere along the coast if they are allowed to leave port.

Italia Airfield: The bulk of Romagna and Venezia's fighter squadrons in the north are based here. Protected by a fortress of AA guns and covered with hangers for hundreds of fighters, and even a few Witches.

Alpine Defense Perimeter:

If there's anything that'll stop you, it'll be this.
A massive net of AA guns of all calibres, built in a dozen key locations across the mountains. Unless you destroy these, your transports will be blown to pieces.

Aside from this, there are several lesser military bases near the Alps. Once clear of the Alps, you can land your transports anywhere. But first, you must secure a clear landing zone for them.

*What are your orders?*
