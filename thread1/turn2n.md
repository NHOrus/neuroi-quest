#Turn 2, Neuroi News

###Empire-wide news.

- **Military News says Fahrong will soon be defeated!** Just like they said last year! And the year before that! And the year before that!

- **Tensions rise between `206` and `302`!** Boarder patrols between the two Hive Clusters exchanged fire recently, each claiming the other was violating its territory. Investigations under-way. Civilians advised to avoid the territory of the two Clusters in case conflict breaks out.

- **Protests along the Fringes!** Members of the Movement for the Union of Sentients (MUS) launch another mass protest at the Empire's actions to fellow sentient species, denouncing the common exterminations as barbaric and unprovoked. The Movement has been gaining a large amount of supporters in the borders of the Empire, enough that a crackdown by the military could have severe consequences.

###Human Intelligence

- **Orussia protests Britannia's and Gallia's actions** The Orussian Tsar has expressed his displeasure at the withdrawal of the European Pacific Fleets from the attack on Vladivastok. The two governments claim it was necessary to ensure the safety of their own territory in light of the Neuroi attack on Baltland. Relations are cooling rapidly, and some fear a Cold War will begin once the Neuroi are gone.

- **Civil War in Zhong Guo (RL China)** Zhong Guo has been heavily divided since the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, and now, with all the Neuroi a long way away, Civil War has erupted. The main combatants seem to be the Communists under Mao Zedong, and the Allied-backed Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek. While the Nationalists have the advantage in military assets and support from the Allies, the Communists enjoy a great deal of popular support, and more and more Allied soldiers are being called to assist the Nationalists in putting down these "dangerous insurgents who seek to undo everything we who have fought the Neuroi for our homes stand for".
