##Quotes and snippets from Chimeraguard, explaining universe and history of it.

I imagine it is about stuff like: Can a bunker stop a Neuroi laser? How effective is trench warfare against us? Do we need combat engineers to entrench ourselves when we fight a trench line? Or can we cost effectively overrun it.

Well, in the opening stages of the war, the Neuroi didn't bypass the Maginot Line, they steamrolled through it.  
Of course, tech has advanced since then, so doing that now might leave you with plenty of dead Neuroi.  
Humanity's advancing their fortifications, especially AA, rapidly, so trench warfare might be a good way to play it.
