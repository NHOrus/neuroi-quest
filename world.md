##Quotes and snippets from Chimeraguard, explaining universe and history of it.

I imagine it is about stuff like: Can a bunker stop a Neuroi laser? How effective is trench warfare against us? Do we need combat engineers to entrench ourselves when we fight a trench line? Or can we cost effectively overrun it.

Well, in the opening stages of the war, the Neuroi didn't bypass the Maginot Line, they steamrolled through it.  
Of course, tech has advanced since then, so doing that now might leave you with plenty of dead Neuroi.  
Humanity's advancing their fortifications, especially AA, rapidly, so trench warfare might be a good way to play it.

GM, do we Have to go over the mountains? Or can we circle around.  
And how many targets can our laser hit?

Well, you could go around, but you'd be attacking one of the intact navies from the ocean, far away from any Outposts to supply your forces, so your forces would likely be wrecked.  
Your lasers can sweep over areas of ground.  
And remember, you have human communications. You can do *plenty* of things with access to human comms.

Funny thing is, the Neuroi are dying.
So are the Fahrong.
The war has wiped out trillions of lives of both sides. More and more resources are required to fuel the machines of war on both sides, and the number of worlds suitable for harvest is running down.
Sooner or later, I'd the war doesn't end, the only left of the Neuroi and Fahrong will be endless hordes of war machines and generals, endlessly fighting for civilizations that have already fallen.

our Cluster is a bit busy. 302 outnumbers 206 by a decent bit, so no reinforcements for a while at least.
And, well, they know you're in command, so things must have gone wrong somewhere.

Planetary shields might be possible, would be pretty expensive though, that's high level PMC tech at its cheapest.


Neuroi Empire's population numbers at least in the low tens of quadrillions.

302 and 206 have been rivals due to conflicting interests, resource scarcity, and, in one case, an important figure in 302 accidentally getting killed by a 206 PMC training exercise.
