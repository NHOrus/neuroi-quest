June 4th, 1946.

Lieutenant Havildar Lachhiman Gurung of the 28th Special Air Services calmly counted the seconds in his head as his men waited. The men of his platoon, all long veterans, waited as perfectly still as he was. It was so quiet that Havildar could hear the faint ticks of the small pocket watch Sergeant Fazal Din kept attached to his belt.

There was nothing in the room to focus his eyes on except his comrades. Drab, off white walls that were perfectly featureless and a low ceiling with long rows of primitive fluorescent bulbs created an acute sense of claustrophobia. Almost like an office space, excepting that no windows nor doors could be seen set into walls. It was a black room, one of the perfectly insulated briefing rooms of the Secret Intelligence Service of Britannia, MI6.

There was the quiet snick of a latch unlocking. As one, the platoon turned their necks to stare at one blank section of wall. A seam appeared, then the door slid away, revealing an nondescript man in a plain grey suit. Not at all showing surprise at the roomful of men all staring at him the man walked in.

"I am the briefer for your upcoming mission. I will skip the usual formalities, your mission will be supporting an infiltration and rescue of the prisoners held within Harbin City Hospital, codenamed Hotel Two."

His words faded abnormally quickly in the Black room.

Havildar frowned as his men shifted uncomfortably, his platoon had previous experience with hostage extraction, but nothing of this scale. They had all heard through the grapevine of the scale of atrocity that Fuso were committing, there would be likely anywhere between two to three thousand bodies in need of help. Even on the low end, that was ten times the size what the 28th SAS had worked on previously.

"You will be supported by the 106th irregular operations company for assistance during the extraction, if absolutely needed, the 15th reconnaissance corps is on site currently and can assist in combat operations. In the initial reconnaissance and final extraction, you will be assisting Secret Intelligence Service Agent Zero Zero Seven."

"A pleasure gentlemen. MI6 Agent Zero Zero Seven, Bond, Janissary Bond.", a voice rang out from the back of the auditorium.

Havildar barely managed in restraining himself from jumping out of his seat. Most of his men were so composed. Chairs flew as his men leaped away from the unexpected voice, hands drawing concealed weapons.

Havildar puffed at his moustache as he turned around, he had told them to disarm before entering the SIS headquarters, but as expected, none had listened, sneaking all manner of implements past the search. He himself kept a blade hidden in his throat.

There was a woman sitting at the back of the auditorium, dressed in a sharp black suit that was all angles. Long brown hair framed a devastatingly beautiful face, complemented by her generous body. Halvildar frowned at that, most of the intelligence Witches he'd met had been pretty enough to charm men, but not beautiful. Beautiful was memorable and that was counterproductive.

Then again, Witches.

She smiled pleasantly at the assembly of shocked men, "Call me Jans."

With a slight cough, the man at the auditorium stuffed something, Havildar suspected a sidearm, out of sight before continuing, voice dry as ever, "As I stated, she will be your point man in this mission. Agent Bond will now take over this briefing for specifics."

June 10th, 1946

Intelligence analyst Charles Stross fingered at his necktie as he arranged his papers.

The room was deathly cold, deathly silent and the colourless pale light shining directly down on him did not help. Dim light illuminated the silhouettes of the men sitting above and around him in the gallery. He felt like a animal in a zoo, scrutinised from every angle.

Coughing slightly to clear his voice, he began his presentation, "The following material is classified DECEMBER TYRANT BLACK, if you do not-"

"Skip the formalities and get on with it Mr Jones." a voice, electronically distorted, from the gallery interrupted him.

Charles paused for a second and when no voices rose up to object to the interruption, skipped the first page of his report.

"As of May thirty first, nineteen forty six, Liberion has been under national emergency codes BANDERSNATCH and HYDRA following the discovery of Fuso experimenting with Project 215, code named XK-PLUTO-"

"And how the hell did they get their hands on that? The Orussians only had technical files left on that. We shut that down, there should not have been any way to recreate it."

Again, Charles paused for a second, turning over more pages of his report, "Following an official request from Fuso, note that they were not signatories to the Dresden Agreement of 1921, Liberion provided samples of XK-PLUTO to Fuso on the single condition that future research direction focus exclusively on directing XK-PLUTO towards the Neuroi. It is believed that Orussia is also complicit in providing their technical files for what they call Koschei."

"We did what? On the singular condition? The public had always rejected biological warfare in general and human experimentation in particular. Not even the negroes were disposable enough to be put through such programs. The civilian administration has been quite clear-"

"Sir. The military administration disagrees with the civilian administration in this case. In particular, Big Black authorised this project via the SHEPARD Protocol."

The men around him shuffled. Indistinct mummers broke out.

"… No more questions, Mr Jones. Proceed with your report."

Charles flipped back to the second page, nodding, "Very well sir. On the 27th of May, a whistle blower from Harbin City Hospital…"

He spoke mechanically, only pausing to answer questions. The briefing was thankfully short, lasting only three hours.

"In conclusion, Big Black concludes, and the Agency agrees, that with time and sufficient subjects, XK-PLUTO can be directed at the Neuroi. If permission is granted for operation OVERCAST, we will attempt to retrieve Fuso's research on XK-PLUTO and subsequently disavow Liberion of any involvement in the research of XK-PLUTO."

Charles stopped. Closing the folder. Waiting.

He waited for another three hours as the men above him deliberated, voices muted and indistinct through a white noise generator.

The low ringing of the sonic interference finally stopped as a voice from the gallery rang out, "Mister Jones, following deliberations, this council is five votes yea and two votes nay in granting the Central Intelligence Agency all necessary permissions to carry out operation OVERCAST."

Exactly as expected.

Charles saluted upwards, "Approval by majority received. The Agency will move immediately."

Charles Stross spun on heel and exited the top secret briefing room beneath Whiskey Hotel.

June 12th, 1946

"Marshalrodavoisk, Liberion has just severed diplomatic ties with Fuso. They are also denying all knowledge of Project Koschei."

"Expected, but disgusting none the less."

"Now that Koschei can be directed, it may well be the salvation of humanity. I do not understand their thinking. If this was half a year ago, I would understand and agree with their disgust, but now…"

"The policy of Liberion is at the mercy of its citizenry. The citizenry of Liberion are not under threat. Never have been. No Neuroi has set foot upon their mainland. Not even one attack. Ever. Do you really believe those sheltered cattle would understand how we suffer? They might as well not be human."

"I suppose that we will not be doing the same then?"

"I do not know. Ultimately, that is up to the Tsar. I will be stationing forces closer to Harbin to guard against sabotage however. Some of our very best. We're so close. We must not fail. Hundreds of Millions are counting on us."

XxXxXxXxXx

June 17th, 1946

"So. Why exactly are we here?" Squadron Leader Yion Green demanded, looking over the logistic base that was to be their new airbase for 'the next couple of months' as quoted by Marshalrodavoisk Novikov.

Her fellow Squadron Leader Alexis Shubin shrugged, fiddling with her maintenance kit, carefully adjusting the air intakes for her strikers with a frown. The usually upbeat and cheerful pyrokinetic Witch stayed silent, running her magic through the striker unit to test for faults. Yion knew the other Witch was perturbed by the bizarre assignment also.

An entire Wing of 52 Witches, suddenly pulled from the frontline city of Blagoveshchensk and stuffed into a rear line logistics base. It was a huge logistic base, but a logistic base none the less. This is where cargo planes rested between trips, not a Wing of Strike Witches.

It was all the more confusing in that they not just any Wing, the 52 Witches, standing around and looking lost in the hanger, were the 3rd Wing of the Orussian 1st Air Assault Group.

They were the Berkut.

Some of Orussia's most fearsome combatants Witches were here.

Here. A backwater in Northern Zhong Guo, nowhere near the Neuroi's line of advance.

"Maybe… we'll be called to attack that… hospital." said Alexis uncomfortably.

"Wait, don't tell me you believe those rumours?" Yion snapped.

Alexis met her eyes levelly, "For what other reason do you suppose we are being posted here?"

Yion opened her mouth, then closed it with a snap. Turning around and marching to her own striker unit, she furiously denied the idea of this alleged Unit 731 in her head.

There was no way. Just no way.

XxXxXxXxXx

June 25th, 1946

Lieutenant Havildar watched in the near dawn darkness as Janissary Bond strode through the front doors of 'Harbin City Hospital' alongside a gaggle of researchers, just like she had everyday for the last month.

"Can you see her?" one of his men muttered, his eyes searching over the group. The moment Havildar was distracted, Jans seemed to slip between two of the men and no matter how hard he squinted, he could not find her again.

The steel doors shut. Putting down his binoculars, Havildar sighed, "She is already inside, I could see her until I was distracted this time."

"Bakrichod" swore Fazal, the sergeant flipped one of the men a cigar. The private smirked as he lit the cigar, taking in a long pull, looking at Fazal the whole time. The sergeant scowled at the man and marched into the back room.

Havildar shook his head lightly, Janissary Bond was simply incredible. She could walk up to a person, and simply… disappear, as if she was never there. She had called her technique 'Shadow Tracking', explaining it as simply staying in the blind spot of one target and using him to shield herself from the vision of another. A load of crap, it was obviously magic of some kind, but even if she explained it in detail, it would just fly over the heads of his men anyway, so he didn't begrudge her for it.

Without her, the 28th SAS would never have gotten within a hundred meters of the outer wall without at least three companies of men with them for a diversionary attack.

The facility had bunkered down, abandoning pretences of being a hospital, now bristling with guns. On their scouting missions, posing as vendor caterers, the 28th SAS had noted more anti-aircraft, artillery, tanks and the soldiers required to man such a force within the complex walls. The locals now called it the Butcher's Nest.

This increased security had good reason to be here.

After the leak of what the actual purpose of the building upon the hill had been, a protest had formed in front of the facility. Nationalist troops had shown up with orders to break apart the protest, then stood around, doing nothing, the local soldiers disillusioned with their orders. The officers, also locals, hadn't made particular effort to encourage their men either.

The civilians had grown bold at the nonresponse from the Zhongwen troops and increased in number day by day, setting up a huge camp on the surrounding farmlands, encircling the Fusoan facility. They had marched on the facility two or three times, but had yet to break through the fence in the face of machine nests positioned on the grounds. With angry civilians blockading the road convoys, the only way in and out of the facility was the elevated train line, and even that had some people camping upon it initially, though they scattered when the military trains coming back and forth from the facility showed no signs of slowing.

Now, after a month, their numbers had swelled to at least fifty thousand people in a growing tent city around Hotel Two, the extent of the camp was so great that they even outgrew the various secret escape tunnels from the facility. Even civilians from other countries had made their way to the northern city to join in the demonstrations against the injustice within those white walls.

Still the nationalists troops did nothing, simply standing by at the sides. A looming threat, but to which side? Their own civilians, or the Fusoan facility? The 28th SAS had bet money on the eventual outcome, most solidly crediting that the Zhongwen troops would mutiny and protect their own.

The entire situation was a tinderbox ready to explode.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Thankfully, tensions are currently running high, allowing us options in both our infil and exfil."

"Sierra team will infiltrate the facility's first perimeter, and when dawn breaks along with the first rally, we will fire upon the civilians and the Zhongwen nationalist forces directly."

"Hopefully this will lead to open exchanges of fire between the two factions here. If this does not, we prime the autos to fire upon the Facility from within the Zhongwen ranks. If even this fails to draw an appropriate response, we detonate the satchel charges within the civilian camp."

"Using the ensuring commotion, we will enter the facility proper. Our best info is from the schematics given to Fuso, based off Fort Norton. Hopefully, they have not changed the design too much."

"Charlie team is preparing to board the next supply train to the facility, that will be exfil one…"

XxXxXxXxXx

The horizon was glowing red, people around their shack were waking up. It was in the tent city, simmering with restrained tension, that the 28th SAS had established themselves.

Posing as Indian migrant workers whom had not heard the rumours, then the news, they arrived to Harbin in discreet groups of two and three a week after Agent 007 had arrived herself for first recon. Somehow, despite their precautions and agreement to meet at a specified rendezvous, Agent 007 had found each and every one of the men of the 28th SAS, directing them to this safe house to the East of Facility.

Walking into the inner room, Havildar looked down at the table. A blueprint of the facility, labelled and scaled, in Hindi at that, lay on the desk. This is what Janissary had been working on through the last month. Annotations and notes lay over the map, pointing out places of interest.

The surface facility was just a façade, the underground portion was enormous, stretching a half kilometer in all directions, networks of dense hallways and rooms extending in a labyrinthine nightmare. Hallways on a slight incline, missing junctions with each other where intuition would say there should be, fake walls, empty rooms with decoys and pit traps of all things. If the 28th SAS had attempted to enter the underground portions blind, they would have died to a man without achieving anything.

You could lose half of the population of New Dheli inside the facility… which was very nearly what the Fusoans had actually done.

Despite the massive sheets of paper, there were still blank spots in the map. The sheer scale of facility damned the nationalists government even if no other evidence existed. There was no way Fuso managed to construct this monstrosity of a facility on foreign soil without notice.

He and his entire team would have liked to wait for more intelligence, but with the true nature of the facility exposed, the Fusoans would be desperate. The longer they waited, the less of there would be for them to rescue.

XxXxXxXxXx

Yasmine Sudoki made a wide turn, trying to manoeuvre around a thick cloud bank. She had been on a scouting flight, looking over the black swarms of Neuroi far below her to the east when the weather took a turn for the worse.

At her altitude, the sun was peeking out over the horizon, shining into her eyes and making her job harder. Finally clearing the cloud, Yasmine squinted. The Neuroi swarms, flying languidly in huge spirals when she last seen them, were now almost static, still against the backdrop of dawn.

"Commander Meyer, Yasmine calling in. No irregularities in the Neuroi, looks like they aren't sortieing for the moment."

"Roger that Lieutenant Sudoki, return to base- ah, I've got a call, be back on the line soon."

Yasmine nodded, not that Anne back at base could see it, and turned to fly back.

The clouds she was flying next to was roiling, growing even thicker and greyer.

"Probably going to be storm, should also report that." mused Yasmine. Tapping the broadcast button, a squeal of static interrupted her. Glancing at her belt to confirm that all the wires were plugged in correctly, Yasmine frowned. The new, long range radios were supposed to be durable.

Looking back up, the black expanse of a Neuroi large type breaking upwards through the cloud bank filled her view.

A red glow.

Yasmine felt a brief sensation of heat.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sunray, this is Delta, they've got a sub the size of a cruiser here. Do we have final?"

"Delta, this is Sunray. You have final. Begin."

XxXxXxXxXx

A single burst of static rang over the radio. Halvildar glanced around, every man around him nodded once in unison. His men were all ready.

Havildar tapped the heavy radio set, smuggled in piece by piece, thrice. Squads one and two were ready.

A pause, then three more bursts of static. Green light from squads three and four of the 28th SAS at another safe house to the east of the Butcher's Nest.

A moment later and the support team, on the train which would come and do a rolling pickup of the hostages through the facilities train line, rang back with three bursts of static. The train was rolling.

Four bursts of static answered them all. The operation was on.

He turned to his men and nodded. Three hauled back a heavy piece of canvas, and Halvildar himself pulled back the trap door. An earthen tunnel dropped down fifteen meters, exposing concrete beneath it. One of the secret tunnels leading to the facility.

Pulling down his helmet, Havildar grabbed the rope and rappelled down, followed by the 32 men of squads one and two of the Special Air Services Twenty Eighth Platoon.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Jamming? Across the entire theatre?"

"Yes General, all the frontline positions can only be reached through landlines now. We believe the Neuroi are going to make another push at Blagoveshchensk towards the north."

General Joeseph Stillwell frowned, rubbing at his stubble. The bloody Neuroi were up to something.

"Alert all sectors to go to condition one, I want eyes looking everywhich way."

XxXxXxXxXx

"They come."

Chatting died away and spoons were set down the moment Squadron Leader Nina Kulagina, night Witch of Berkut Wing spoke.
"Where, which city to the north?" Wing Commander Sasha Vasilyev stood up, her breakfast forgotten.

Meeting her eyes, Nina languidly shook her head, also standing up, "Not to the north. Here. They come."

Silently as one, the other 50 Witches of Berkut Wing stood and started filing out of the mess hall.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sunray, we've got a snag. The train has a detachment of Witches alongside what looks like a platoon of soldiers on it and none of the regular crew."

"Say again Acorn. Witches?"

"Confirm Sunray. Looks like spec ops."

"Sierra team, pause operation, Charlie team has run into complications."

"Sunray. Unable. We cannot return to the primers in time."

"Shit. Acorn, can you ID those Witches or soldiers?"

"Negative Sunray. No insignia. Soldiers are multinational. Witches are European, that's as much as I can tell."

XxXxXxXxXx

Far under the ground, a river flowed. Running through the volcanic tunnels that ran through the hard igneous rocks buried far below the soft sediments deposited by the Songhua river, the underground Songhua river had a flow rate more than five thousand times greater than the above ground river.

Occasionally, the underground river ascended, intersecting with the surface river. If one was determined enough, they could plot a submarine through these twisting caves and reach the underground river through the above ground river. 'Harbin City Hospital' had three underwater ports, in two of them, workers hurriedly loaded documents, samples and equipment into the I-400 class submarines, preparing to save the vital files, too important to risk interception through transmission and far too important to destroy.

One of the soldiers, carrying an important case, abruptly slipped and fell into the water.

The nearby sergeant marched over, bellowing curses at the man's incompetence, the current was fast and if those files were damaged or lost-

He himself stepped wrong even as he berated the soldier, who had yet to resurface, splashing into the dark waters himself.

All over the docks, men slipped and fell into the black waters, never to surface.

One soldier ran for the phone, grabbing the headset.

"Hello? Dock three, what's wrong?"

"Nothing. The headset slipped off that's all."

Dripping water, the Witch calmly placed the receiver back onto the switch hook.

"Shrikes, move out."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sunray, there are other spec ops in the underground docks. Witches. Unknown allegiance."

"You've got to be shitting me Acorn. Are Delta already within the subs?"

"Confirm Acorn, Delta squad is already in the subs. They're blue water subs so I can't raise them on comms either."

XxXxXxXxXx

Janissary Bond placed another demolition charge delicately above the hanging light. Below, staff hurried back and forth, unaware of the Witch that prowled on the lights above them.

Through the complex, high explosive shaped charges were set, timed correctly, they would sink the west side of the surface complex. Even when she had first arrived, the western rooms were already empty, or held occupants who were already… beyond help. It seemed the rooms to the west were mostly for 'static samples', meaning body parts, corpses and the like.

The underground structure was so heavily reinforced with cross bracing that sinking one side should cause the entire building to lean like an enormous teeter totter. The highest corridors should emerge from the ground with how much the structure will tilt. That would give Lieutenant Havildar and the hostages they would be escorting a clear run for the train line through the tilted structure directly to the surface rather than backtrack the extensive spiral pattern back towards the surface.

Lightly running over the hanging lights, Janissary ran to the third last position for her demolition charges.

There was another pack of explosives there, stuck onto the wall, a damp handprint on the wall next to it. This explosive was not one of hers.

Agent 007 thumbed her throat mike twice, the magic boosted radio sending the signal through her repeaters Lieutenant Havildar and his men.

A snag.

XxXxXxXxXx

Still leaving the occasional drop of water behind them, the Witches of Shrike squad sprang forth into the compound. The retrieval of researchers and their research was their primary objective, but collecting samples of the experimental subjects was a vital secondary objective.

Ahead, one of her comrades had paused, lightly hovering above the light. She gestured at the corner.

Shrike Leader paused. This was unexpected. A small radio relay station. Britannian in design.

It was clean unlike the dusty surroundings. Newly placed.

Clearly other nations wanted a piece of the pie.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Hello Shack Two, we're now at condition one, you guys got anything for us?"

…

"Shack Two? Come in. You better not be playing a prank on us here."

…

"Boss, Shack Two is off the line. Neuroi may be heading due west."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sunray, go or no go. We cannot disarm the presets."

"Sunray to all. OVERCAST is go. Repeat, go loud, go loud."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Huan woumen de ren! Huan woumen de ren! Huan woumen de ren!" The gathering civilians were just beginning to chant, shouts ringing out as they pressed against the outer fence.

Black and white photos were shoved through gaps of the fence, parents with missing children shouting up at the distant guards, whom stood at the second line of fences.

The chant swelled, soon, it would grow into a huge roar as more people joined the daily rally. The Fusoan facility had remained silent through this month, so when the sharp cracks of automatic fire rang out, people paused in shock rather than run.

The Fusoan guards at the gate watched in shock and confusion as the gathered civilians milled in chaos as the staccato beat of automatic fire continued.

Finally, screams ran out as people fell, painted red.

One Fusoan guard stepped forwards, then stumbled back as red dots stitched up his body, a Zhongwen soldier pouring machinegun rounds into him.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sierra to Sunray. Diversion successful, both sides have opened up. We're in. Moving to primary objective."

"Charlie to Sunray, do we ride this out or take the Witches down. They don't have shields up."

"Sunray to Charlie, hold fire, only fire if fired upon."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Uhhh, Sunray. Alarms are ringing and this nest of ants has been kicked."

"What the hell? Hold one Acorn."

"Spyglass to all, Zhongwen and Fusoan troops are exchanging fire at the gates."

"Now of all times…"

XxXxXxXxXx

Alarms rang out, almost deafening Sergeant Fazal.

"We're sprung! Go loud, go! Go! Go!"

Squads three and four of the 28th SAS abandoned all pretences of subtlety, charging right into the guard checkpoint, silenced weapons coughing.

XxXxXxXxXx

Alarms rang through the room.

Lieutenant Havildar paused, holding up a closed fist. He let go of an Fusoan soldier, the man sliding to the ground, a second mouth grinning and drooling red under his first. Behind him, a convoy of nearly two hundred prisoners followed the sixteen men of squad one. Most of the prisoners had still been healthy, only recently brought in, but many carried more emaciated prisoners, victims whom had suffered here for longer. The 28th SAS had known they could only save a portion of the prisoners here, even with the help of the 106th, but the people they rescued were determined, carrying those too sick to move by themselves.

Havildar had not the heart to refuse them, even though he knew most of those in such a condition would die before they received treatment anyway.

It was too early for Agent 007 to spring the alarm and detonate her charges. Something had gone wrong.

XxXxXxXxXx

"This is not a question of jurisdiction! The Neuroi are on their way!"

"Orussia is the only country that has not publicly condemned Fuso for their actions in my city. For all I know, you're lying and on your way to shoot my men."

Brigadier General Zhu Bang Jian stood firmly in the Witches path, barring their way to the hanger. He'd just received word that the Fusoans had finally cracked and were firing on the surrounding civilians. Apparently his own men couldn't take much more of it either and fired back. Whilst he had orders to cooperate with Fuso and Orussia from Commander in Chief Jiang Jieshi himself, he'd be damned if he let his men get gunned down by Witches before allowing them time to evacuate the civilians and withdraw like he'd ordered.

Sasha grit her teeth in anger, they were wasting time, if the Neuroi force arrived in energy range of Harbin, especially with that giant encampment in the middle of the plains, hundreds of thousands would die without ever seeing the shadow of a shelter.

"General, move aside. Or I will move you aside."

The Zhongwen General stared resolutely at the Orussian Wing Commander. A Witch powerful enough to tear apart tanks barehanded standing within arms reach.

He didn't step a single centimeter back.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Neuroi for fucks sake! Neuroi on nape of earth flight on approach. Harbin City, you've got Neuroi less than half an hour out! By God and Nation, acknowledge!"

Major Beng De Ren frowned at the headset of the phone. He didn't speak Orussian. Why did a call have to come in as General Zhu took the interpreters outside to confront those Orussian Witches?

Yawning, Major Beng transcribed the mans words phonetically then put the headset down, ignoring the frantic words. It was probably some Ivan getting a pole shoved up his ass over delays in supplies again. Every call to the South Harbin Logistic base seemed to be in those lines. They even made it sound like a big deal when some transport train or plane was half an hour late, who cares? It would get there eventually.

Laying his head down into his arms, he felt his eyelids droop. It was too early for this.

Ten minutes later, Major Deng was already asleep at his desk when another phone call came in, "This is Colonel Zheng of the Perimeter defences, Harbin Base, come in!"

XxXxXxXxXx

"Hawk Actual, emergency. Don't look now but an entire company of men just boarded your train. Spec ops, no insignia. European by the looks of them."

The leader of SIS 15th reconnaissance corps felt her mouth twist into a frown. What on earth? Gallia? South Afrika? Maybe even Hispania. Didn't really matter who they were, they were intruding on the op.

How would she deal with this?

XxXxXxXxXx

All of those overlapping plans ground to an abrupt halt as a radio screech blasted across every frequency. From Harbin's perimeter defences.

"Jingji Tongzhi! Jingji Tongzhi! Houma Jiu Jiu Yi! Hei Yaomo! Hei Yaomo!"

The ground trembled through the entire facility and a squeal of static blasted across the radio.

For a moment, the lights inside the facility flickered.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Acorn, Spyglass! What the hell was that?"

"Acorn Actual to Sunray, it wasn't anything down here."

"Spyglass. What's going on? Spyglass come in."

"*Cough* Sunray. Emergency. Code Nine Nine One."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Sunray to Sierra. Emergency code Nine Nine One. You've got twenty minutes to get what you're there for and get out. Charlie, hurry that train up, I don't care how you do it!"

XxXxXxXxXx

Agent 007 winced as her mike screeched in her ear, loud enough for the soldiers passing beneath her to look up, breaking her Shadow Tracking. What came through next made their rising rifles a minimal concern.

"Hawk Five to all, Code Nine Nine One!"

XxXxXxXxXx

"Shrike, this is Thorn. Emergency Code Nine Nine One. Grab what you need, get back down here- hey! Who are you-?! *Mffgh*! Never mind who I am, Code Nine Nine One? Ze Neuroi? Zey're here?"

Shrike paused. Hesitating.

Another party was down at the docks, resulting in possible mission failure, unacceptable. Shrike squad turned and sprinted down back towards the docks.

XxXxXxXxXx

A bright flash turned the horizon white as sirens wailed out across the base. The Orussian Witches all recognised it, some rubbing at faint burn scars.

It was the Hellfire discharge of Neuroi large type.

"General, for the last time, move."

General Zhu stepped aside, face ashen. He rushed back towards the command post. The Orussian Witch could command her people, he needed to be there for his.

A tremendous rumble echoed across the base, distant thunder from the oncoming storm.

XxXxXxXxXx

Like leviathans of lore, the Neuroi approached, over ten large types leading the charge, looming as they flew across the plains, barely meters between them and the ground. Around them, various smaller Neuroi flitted back and forth, a crowd of flies circling a carcass, sheltering behind the bulk of the large types.

Farmers gaped, terror paralysing them as the Neuroi passed over head.

Not a single laser was fired.

There was no need to.

At their speeds, the shockwave accompanying the flying behemoths was enough to tear apart the land. Houses were smashed like so many matchsticks, carefully irrigated soil churned and was blasted into the air and humans followed them, ants brushed off the shoulder of the Neuroi advance.

Advancing with the dawn, the Neuroi turned the Eastern sky black, bringing back the night.

XxXxXxXxXx

Receiving word from it's own outposts sighting the Neuroi at eighty kilometers to the North East East, Harbin city had less than ten minutes before the Neuroi would enter the twenty two kilometer range of its farthest reaching defences.

Harbin's outer military fortifications, already buzzing and nervous with the weapons fire at the Butcher's Nest, came to life quickly. Guns already orientated to the South East East needed little adjustment, their green crews fumbling the artillery shells with the inexperience speaking of many missed drills.

Still, the guns were readied, crews cowering in half finished fortifications, sabotaged by corruption and management ineptitude. At twenty seven kilometers, Liberion M1 240mm artillery cannons thundered out. What should have been a volley by over three hundred guns was reduced to a mere one hundred and eighteen, the other guns sold, wasting away in storage or left neglected in the open till their beeches were sealed shut with rust, dank rain water collecting within the barrels. Nevertheless, one hundred and eighteen huge shells glided ponderously across the sky, arcing downwards onto the titanic Neuroi large types.

In the one minute of flight time for the shells to reach maximum range, the Neuroi crossed the six kilometer gap between where they were and the M1's maximum range, placing themselves right where the shells would plunge. Lasers lanced out, swatting the thin volley of shells contemptuously.

The shells hit exploded into tungsten spikes, the supersonic submunitions screaming down at the Neuroi force.

XxXxXxXxXx

Colonel Zheng Ye Tian gripped the binoculars so hard his knuckled whitened. Around him, his artillery crew cheered, ecstatic at landing a first strike at the Neuroi.

"Direct hits, direct hits! The shells landed dead center in the Neuroi force-!" cheered voices from the intercom.

Fucking rookies, they didn't even confirm kills.

Snatching the phone headset, Colonel Zheng spat into the intercom, "Shaddup and realign the guns! All Heilong crews, prepare second volley!"

Jamming was already making the airwaves a mess even at this distance so he had to rely on the wired lines.

The men around him broke their celebration, hastily lowering the elevation angle of the mighty artillery piece, the second shell reloaded before the first had even landed.

They worked with mutinous scowls on their faces and Ye Tian mildly regretted his coarse words, but he was furiously with the volley. Not at the aim, the shells would have almost all landed on target, or been close enough that the Neuroi shot them down, but at the result.

Only half of the shells had exploded into tungsten spikes upon contact with the lasers, the others failed to detonate, trailing vaporised brass casing and tungsten spikes, showing their explosive filling had been removed, some of the other shells simple evaporated in mid air, those had both the explosive filling and tungsten spike removed and replaced with garbage. In other words, at least half of the already depleted gun force might as well have been firing blanks.

In addition, he had seen the huge flying Neuroi deploy… no it must have been a trick of the light.

Whatever the case, he was going to find that shualai de kongbu fenzhi whom had been stealing his ammunition, and he was going to fire that bendan out of his cannon at the Neuroi as a replacement for the good shells the moron had sabotaged!

Worse, his phone line at Perimeter HQ couldn't raise South Logistic Base for whatever reason. Sticking his head around a corner, the Colonel bellowed down the hallway, "Major Xing, has command responded yet?"

Another officer at the comms center stuck his head into the corridor, shouting back a reply, "No sir, no response to our calls!"

Colonel Zheng swore as he swung back to the observation post. Was some asshole asleep at the phone interchange or something?

"Gun ready!"

A litany of reports came of the same. Confirming that the Neuroi were going to be in the shells landing area, Colonel Zheng roared, "Fire!"

An unsteady drumbeat sounded out as the artillery pieces volleyed again. Hopefully this time, there would be less dud shells.

Raising his binoculars, Colonel Zheng frowned. A bright white light was shining from the tip of the leading Neuroi flying type. It wasn't their signature red glow that signified a incoming laser shot so…

"What the…? Uh sir?"

Lowering the binoculars with an angry huff, Colonel Zheng turned, raising a questioning eyebrow. His jaw dropped at the sight. His men were working to reload the cannon yes, but all their hair was standing up on end. Even their eyebrows stuck out from their faces at comical angles.

The white glow was growing brighter.

Raising a hand to his own head, Colonel Zheng noted the same was happening to him. What the hell was going on?

The white glow was painfully bright for a moment.

Just one moment.

XxXxXxXxXx

Sasha Vasilyev hastily performed last minute checks on her strikers.

Engine temperature normal. Turbine speed optimal. Air intakes clear. Magic ingestion rate normal.

She leapt into the air as hard as she could. The Mikoyan-Gurevich Project Nine turbojet striker units roared, air intakes fully open and she shot into the air. Within two seconds, she was two hundred meters above the ground.

"This is Sasha, Berkut lead is clear."

The RD-20 turbojets in each Striker unit provided 7.8 kilonewtons of force, allowing for her to accelerate at ninety meters per second every second. She could break the speed of sound in under four seconds. When she had equipped her first Striker unit ten years ago, one of the single engine Wright backpack models, the speed and power of the Miyafuji dynamo Jet strikers was distant dream. This was not to say that the Jet Strikers were perfect though.

"This is Nina. Jastreb squadron are off."

At high speeds commonly reached in Jet Strikers, the air behaved strangely, thicker, less forgiving. You could not flat spin or flip at high speeds or the engines would flame out, sending the Witch tumbling towards the ground. Recoilless guns and guns with low muzzle velocities behaved strangely above twice the speed of sound, often failing to fire. This added to the fact that once a Witch was flying at over the twice the speed of sound, helmets had to be worn or a shield had to be maintained over the face for most Witches, otherwise even the reinforced constitutions of Witches would have difficulty dealing with the air pressure inside the lungs, the air whipping at the eyes and rushing past the ears. Far and away though the greatest weakness from the Jet Striker was how a single shell casing sucking into the air intakes would cause a fire in the engine at best, and engine explosion at worst, never mind what dropping an entire magazine into the intakes would do. Casing bags and securing harnesses, always a good idea, were now vital.

"Alexis here, Sokol squadron is in the air."

Half a year past, with the Jet Strikers against the Neuroi of half a year past, Berkut Wing would have been invincible, the only thing changing the rate at which they destroyed Neuroi, adding further achievements to their utterly flawless record.

For the eight years of war until half a year past, Berkut Wing were zero friendly casualties, one hundred percent of enemies eliminated, one hundred percent of the time. Never had a city they defended fallen to the Neuroi. The were the front. Where they chose to go was where the Orussian throne would mark the as the frontline, for not a single Neuroi would ever go past that point.

Half a year past, they were the propaganda embodied, legends in the flesh.

Invincible and peerless.

"Squadron Leader Green reporting in, Orel squadron have all taken off."

But half a year past, there had been 64 Witches in Berkut Wing forming 15 flights.

Here and now, there are 52 Witches in Berkut Wing forming 12 flights.

Watching the column of fire rising in the north east, the burning dust cooling from a dull red into ashen grey, Sasha felt in her gut that once again, the Golden Eagle bearing the title of Invincible was going to bleed.

Switching on their LOS shortwave radios, the Wing formed up in a huge cone, cruising forwards slowly for the moment.

"Berkut Wing, we will be striking at heavy bandits. You see a Sorceress, you make damn sure it's alone and you've got your flight with you. At most a pair against your flight. No less than Two to one odds. More show up, you bug out and scream for help. The pride of the dead is worth nothing. Squadron leaders, acknowledge."

"Jastreb. I copy."
"Sokol, Copy that."
"…Orel copies."

Sasha sighed at Yion's unenthusiastic answer. The feeling of hate and thirst for vengeance was hard on those whom never tasted the bitter bile of failure. Those Sorceresses whom appeared half a year past embodied everything that had gone wrong with the war. She'd have to watch Yion and make sure the younger girl does nothing crazy once she sees a Sorceress.

Switching to open channel, Sasha pushed magic through her voice and broadcasted to the entire wing her customary closing statement, "I order all of you, do not die."

"Yes, your majesty!" the concerted reply roared back to her as her magic settled over the entire Wing. Sasha once again felt a slight twinge of guilt at using her magic, but it was for the best.

"Berkut Wing, go V-Max."

Air intakes opened wide and with the explosive boom, Berkut Wing blasted past the sound barrier, heading for the front.

Below them, a war journalist took a photo, catching the Orussian Wing in flight just as another huge flash of light painted the entire vista in black and white.

XxXxXxXxXx

The Neuroi were less than ten kilometers away now.

Eating the distance at one hundred and twenty meters every second, the Neuroi swarm roared forwards. Meeting them, the myriad lesser defences of Harbin opened up, adding their voices to that of the M1 Black Dragon artillery pieces.

First came the M115 Automatic Cannons. Their retorts sounded like chain lightning as they fired 203mm shells at thirty rounds per minute at the leading flying fortresses. Inaccurate, shorter ranged than anything that calibre had business being, but the huge shells flew outwards thick and fast, plunging fire smashing into the incoming swarm. Lasers poured out, each laser sweeping out two or three shells, but the barrage was overwhelming the lasers with their sheer numbers. Within the first minute, the four hundred M115s on Harbin's Northern perimeter had thrown twelve thousand shells at the incoming Neuroi.

The stream of fire was so thick that for moment smoke from the explosions obscured the Neuroi. The M115s fell silent, not because their gunners wanted to stop, but because loaders all through the city found out to their horror that rather than the preloaded magazine of three hundred shells they were supposed to have, each gun battery had less than forty.

As they frantically scrounged for shells, the cloud hanging in the air nine kilometers away remained quiescent. Hopeful silence reigned for three seconds, four then five.

A red glow emerged from the smoke. The Neuroi creeped out slowly from the smoke, unscathed. An abomination of a huge, multilayered shield stretched between the large types. The Neuroi quickly gathered speed again, roaring in like a tide, a veritable force of nature.

Horror descended amongst the soldiers.

Shields

The Neuroi units had shields.

Horror at the discovery was so strong it verged on disgust. Yet not a single man ran. Some cowered, covering their heads, but all present on the walls knew that their home city and their families lay behind them. Hands fumbled, shells were dropped, but armed with the courage of the dead, the soldiers of Harbin manned their stations and prepared to die shielding those behind them. Some men worked especially frantically, anything to stop his little girl from having to face that which approached. They had all heard the news, frantically suppressed by propaganda agencies, of the spikes in Witch mortality rate.

The abomination of a shield faded quickly, but with the M115s silenced by human corruption and the M1s too few and slow firing, nothing took advantage of the opportunity.

Now just seven kilometers from Harbin, the city defences threw everything they had at the advancing swarm.

88mm FLAK 41 roared out. For a short moment, the leading Neuroi large type, shaped like a torpedo, appeared to almost fall, great gouges cut from its black hide, internal components throwing sparks as they were struck. All of a sudden, it rapidly slowed and another large type manoeuvred in front of it, shielding it as the massive Neuroi lagged further behind, falling to the rear to repair itself.

Six kilometers.

40mm and 20mm Bofors roared out. Tracers turning the sky yellow against the advancing darkness, the waves of fire so thick it was as if humanity were trying to reignite the sun. To bring back the dawn.

Even as the guns fired, the Neuroi large types finally responded. Small and Medium types exploded like chaff against the river of metal curving upwards, cores exploding as bullets hammered into them and shrapnel from FLAK shells exploded amongst them, but they served their purpose as they absorbed the fire aimed for the glowing laser ports of the large types. A heavy laser beam, thicker around than a man was tall, lanced down, striking a Perimeter fortification and it's M1 artillery piece. The beam cleaved through shoddy concrete, past insufficient metal reinforcing, and found the ammunition storage.

The fortification seemed to bulge before exploding outwards, throwing flaming 240mm shells in every direction. The wild shells erupted, spraying tungsten spikes both at the city and the Neuroi overhead.

Four kilometers.

More and more lasers rained down. Devastating whatever they struck. An outlying apartment block, hosting an 88mm FLAK took a heavy laser strike right down it's middle from a large type flying meters above its ceiling, blowing apart the apartment and the surrounding buildings in a five block radius. Flaming bodies were blown clear by the shockwave the apartment simply disintegrated.

Two kilometers.

One lucky M1, it's barrel depressed to minimum, blew a manta ray like large type completely in two with a direct hit. The Neuroi crashed into the ground, flatting a kilometer long swath of housing under its bulk as it slip to a stop. Tracers searched frantically over the wounds but it was not to be. The core was not exposed. Shielded by a swarm of smaller Neuroi and another large type, the lines of fire to the downed Neuroi were blocked by the advancing swarm.

The Neuroi were at the gates.

The large types rapidly slowed as they switched power output from speed to offense and gained altitude, opening more of the city to their lasers while the bulk of the smaller flying Neuroi swarmed downwards, abandoning their mobile cover and using their speed to close with the defences. Soldiers were blitzed, the Neuroi strafing their positions too fast for their guns to track. Heavy mounted guns were abandoned as light machine guns, submachine guns, rifles and even bayonets and fists lashed out at the smaller Neuroi flyers.

Despite this though, more and more guns opened up throughout the city as the Neuroi large types ascended, direct fire guns, previously denied line of sight by the low altitude flight finally having targets to fire upon. In the south half of the city, the much older fortifications added their own firepower to the mix, the older guns and slower shells missing much more often than their advanced descendants in the Perimeter defences.

Strafing to face a cluster of fortresses at the edge of the city proper, a point of stark white light built upon the prow of a pyramid shaped large type, hellfire building at the prow of its battering ram shaped hull. Every single gun which could be brought to bear instantly switched target, but another batlike large type slid in below it, another of the nauseatingly red shields appearing. The sheer volume of fire and the fact that it was only a single large type projecting the shield caused it to fail within seconds, fire now tearing into the defending large type's wing.

For a moment the defending large sagged, critical components destroyed, red lights flickering across its hull, but then it dissolved part of it own body, allowing the charging large type a clear shot where the other large type had been previously blocking it.

Plasma lanced down, white light brighter than the sun flash blinding the thousands of soldiers firing upwards.

The north eastern side of the city simply ceased to be.

Concrete and steel melted. Flesh evaporated. Ammunition cooked off, their rounds disintegrating from the heat in mid-air.

The shockwave smashed into the city, collapsing buildings, throwing soldiers into the air. Refugees, stuck on the streets outside overcrowded shelters, found the blast wave channelled down the streets by the highrise buildings. The hellishly hot air blasted into them, scorching flesh, setting hair and clothing on fire.

Everything within a kilometer diameter of the hellfire strike was flattened, fires raging out of control.

For moment, the city was silent, the soldiers stunned and dazed by the blinding flash and tremendous noise.

Slowly, fire picked up, the soldiers doing anything they could to stop the Neuroi that now hovered over Harbin City Center from firing upon the exposed civilians.

To the South, army units that had finally returned from their posts in front of the Fusoan facility now began firing, mobile platforms rushing through the poor quality, congested streets firing with futile fury. Witches from the local garrison buzzed overhead, screened by fighters and bombers. The pilots were green, the aircraft were outdated, the guns and bays were low on ammunition, but if they could distract the Neuroi, if they could take a shot meant for a Witch, it would be worth it.

Medium and small types rushed forwards to face them.

Small and medium types blasted away as fighters and bomber turrets fired back, lasers and gunfire traded back and forth. Humanity came worse off, bombers and fighter hulks falling towards the ground, flaming wrecks that smashed into the city with explosions of aviation fuel and into the Songhua river, throwing up tremendous plumes of water. Not one of the Witches were shot down, and there were no Sorceresses within the Neuroi swarm. The local Witches worked with a vengeance and Neuroi dust was soon growing thick above southern Harbin.

Then the Neuroi swarm of units seemed to shudder, pulling up, and back to North East. Above the developing battle over southern Harbin, bright blue exhaust cones glowed as Berkut Wing passed overhead, making for the Heavy Types over Northern Harbin. The small and medium types fired, but their shots fell pitifully short. Ignoring the losses they were taking from the local garrison and ground formations, they shot into pursuit for the supersonic Witches passing by.

The Neuroi recognised those Witches.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Harbin?! How the fuck did the Neuroi sneak Units past the G201 Radar lines?!" General Joseph Stilwell roared. Around him, aides cowered from the towering wrath of 'Vinegar Joe'.

"Swung North?! We were at condition one! We have allied units-! Didn't tell them?! Why the fuck didn't you tell them?! Fuck you and your politics!" snatching a report from a hurrying aide, the General poured over the information as the man on the other side spoke.

"Well we fucking send reinforcements! Empty fucking Changchun! Get fucking Commander Clair Chennault on the line! Have that girl actually do something with her princesses!"

Smashing the phone headset down, the Liberion General fumed. Of all the times for the Neuroi to start pushing east.

Fuso pulling bullshit. Other nations throwing bullshit tantrums over that bullshit.

God fucking damn!

Who the fuck gave a shit if Fuso killed twenty or thirty thousand people over six months making bioweapons? The Neuroi had killed thirty thousand people every single day in their marches across Afrika and down Romagna. They had killed two and a half million men in Karlsland over a single month. In the attack on the Allied fleet in Baltland, they had killed fifty thousand Liberion sailors in ten minutes.

Now because of those fucking tantrums, another two hundred thousand lives were in jeopardy, with many more guaranteed to die if Harbin fell. If the northern hub city fell, the Eastern front was fucked. Absolutely and utterly fucked. Eastern Siberia would fall within months. Then Neuroi would have free reign over Western Liberion.

Fucking politicians making mountains out of molehills.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Berkut to all squadrons, the large types are too close to the city to take them down, disable then pick out the ones furthest from the City."

Receiving confirmations, Sasha pushed her strikers to their limit, gathering as much speed as possible.

Two kilometers separated the two forces, barely two and a half seconds of travel time at their current speeds, "Sokol, spook their shields."

A tremendous fireball engulfed three large types, lighting up the entire sky. Impressive as it looked, Alexis wasn't a miracle worker. The massive fireball was tepid, barely breaching 600 degrees Celsius for split seconds at its peak.

While she could have made it hotter, at such a size it would still only have inflicted superficial damage, exhausted her magically and eaten the oxygen in the air that the jet strikers needed to fly. What it the fireball was meant to do was alarm. The Large types flared their shields, forming a group shield for the fractions of a second the fireball persisted. With their power split between movement, offense and defence, it would at least a minute until their reserves charged back up to form another collective full body shield.

Splitting into three squadrons, Berkut descended at the now shieldless flying battleships.

Laser were dodged, absorbed and reflected, splashed uselessly off shields or struck transient copies as Orussia's premier combat Wing tore into the large types.

Laser ports were cratered by magic enhanced rounds as the squadrons strafed the large types, super sonic wasps stinging at a bear. The large type that Sasha was attacking began charging a plasma burst, a quick burst of 20mm shells put a stop to that, the gathered plasma destabilising and blowing apart its prow.

Her strikers coughed and with a frown, Sasha shifted her cannon. The engines had a tendency to choke upon inhaling gun smoke and it was the same deal with Neuroi dust. It was one of the problems Berkut had not figured how to deal with easily, you simply had to careful with your gun angle or actively shield the air intakes while firing.

Completing their tight turn around their targets in less than a second, the weapon ports of the Neuroi large types were all destroyed in a single pass. Jastreb, Sokol and Orel withdrew back into the clear sky, using their acceleration and speed to outrun the Neuroi pursuit.

The three targeted large types began to pull away from the city. Withdrawing till they regenerated their complex laser systems.


"Berkut, more Neuroi east. One group of large types on vector to us. Ten kilometers out. Another group large types escorted by a cloud of smaller types vectored to the south. Thirty kilometers out."

Sasha shot a glance over. Advancing from a different direction, a second swarm of Neuroi approached the City, splitting into two thrusts, one heading for the battle over the northern city, the other on a line to strike at the south eastern end. The second group would fly directly over the camp in front of the Butcher's Nest if they passed the defences.

More than anything she would have wanted to keep them clear of the city, stop them before they reached that camp and before they flew over the hospital, annihilating whatever was inside, good or ill, but there was too much air cover for those Neuroi. This was not half a year past. They had to focus on targets of opportunity.

"Berkut, we target the disabled large types on the rear."

Pulling another high G turn, the Squadrons formed back into a wing and burned for the Neuroi large types loitering outside of the city boundaries. Ignoring their previous targets that were retreating from above the city.

Steamrolling through the screen of units guarding the damaged large types outside the city, Berkut swooped down.

Ignoring the few laser ports the damaged large types had repaired, Berkut wing instead fired directly at the cores. Breaking through the though the shields with concentrated firepower, PKP 14.5mm heavy machine guns and HS.404 20mm autocannons tore away the armour of the Neuroi and shattered the cores.

The very first large type that had fallen back from the FLAK-41 fire was the first to die, its smooth torpedo like hull almost fully repaired before it shattered. Next came the batlike large type, still regrowing its wing that it shed whilst shielding the plasma launching large type. Lastly came the wide manta ray shaped large type bisected by the M1 cannon, languishing on the ground, not yet having regrown the components it required to even fly.

"Berkut, local garrison is attacking the large types we disabled. At this rate they'll go down above the city."

Turning, Sasha confirmed that the local Witches were now mixing it against the Neuroi above the city. They concentrated fire on the three retreating large types. Not only the Witches, but the ground defence guns also fired into the bellies of the large types.

"They're still too close, what are the defenders thinking?" demanded Yion.

"Green troops. No experience." Nina responded, taciturn as ever.

Thumbing her shortwave into alliance general frequency, Sasha ordered, "Local Witch squadrons, withdraw from the neutered large types, danger close. Repeat, danger close."

No response except the static of jamming. Dammit.

"Berkut, split back into squadrons, get those large types away from the city. Push them if you have to."

The Witches had barely begun burning back towards the city when the first of the large types died. A missile arcing into its core.

It shattered, exploding into pieces. The Witches around it instinctively raised shields, ignoring the fragments of Neuroi. For the civilians whom were still thick on the streets on their way to shelters, you might as well have detonated the largest anti-personnel grenade in the world above their heads.

Neuroi fragments shrieked through the air. Ricocheting off buildings and the ground, the lethal rain of shrapnel cut down civilians like scythes through wheat. Sasha could see clear lines form in the crowded masses as the Neuroi fragments passed through them, body parts and blood spewing into the air as the fragments cut neatly through the delicate human bodies. The civilians, already jostling in panic at the hellfire to the north, began to stampede, sealing the fate of those knocked over by the Neuroi fragments.

Neuroi dissolved destroyed or severed sections into dust, but as soon as the core was destroyed, the entire Neuroi would explosively shatter, throwing glimmering silver fragments everywhere with lethal speed. For most small Neuroi, the danger was confined, their bodies not having the mass the be dangerous, for the larger types, their deaths were as lethal to those around them as a laser barrage.

Too caught up in their air battle to notice the carnage on the ground, the local Witches pounced upon the other two large types.

"Shitshitshit!"

"Focus Orel, we need to get those other two large types clear!"

Splitting into three squadrons again, Orel and Sokol rammed into the large type, their Jet strikers burning on full, trying to push the Neuroi east, away from the city as Jastreb covered them.

Try being the operative word, the large type barely sped up at all despite the Witches pushing at it. Sasha winced as an uncomfortable heat built around her legs. Pushing the strikers to the max without going at speed to air cool them was dangerous, and they simply didn't provide enough power to move the massive Neuroi large type. They couldn't rely on the turbojets to move it, the Witches would need to leverage their own magic directly.

Even before worrying about power however, they simply were out of time. Sasha could see the bullets impacting closer to the core. They wouldn't come close to making it.

"Orel, pull back, wide scale shields!"

The seventeen Witches of Orel squadron jetted backwards, projecting shields as large as they could, reserving some of their magic for a second, smaller shield to guard their bodies.

The large type shattered.

Fragments smashed into the shields. The large scale shields could not stop the fragments dead as their personal shields could, but they did work to slow them, reducing their lethality.

Seventeen Witches however, even those of Berkut Wing, could not cover the flank of a three or four hundred meter long Neuroi large type.

More fragments scythed down, cutting into the city, spreading further chaos.

Quizzical at the very noticeable shield array of shields Orel Squadron projected, the local Witches paused their attacks on the other large type and followed the progress of the Neuroi dust, finally noticing the effects of it on the City below them. Sasha barely managed to project a long distance shield to stop one local Witch from being speared by a laser as she gasped in shock. Orel and Jastreb squadrons worked overtime, trying to pull horrified Zhongwen Witches from the paths of the Neuroi lasers.

Bogged down by their operations, the smaller types of Neuroi finally caught up to Berkut wing, swarming them. To the east, the other group of large types arrived with more escorts, a rain of light lasers descending and smashing into the city defences as they advanced towards the furball. The large types had adapted to the presence of Witches. Rather than charging their hellfire casters so that each shot would smash fortifications and destroy kilometers of a city at a time, they pulsed, fast and rapid shots surging outwards the flying humans.

Sasha grit her teeth as she projected two shields in front of her as like a ram, accelerating and slicing through a medium type. The bisected Neuroi exploded into dust behind her. Her HS.404 cannon was holstered on her back as she clutched two local Witches to her chest, one crying, one simply pale and shaking. The extra weight dragged and Neuroi swarmed from every direction. Lasers rained down on her and she created a spherical all directional shield. A large type slammed a heavy laser into her flank, straining the shield dangerously. A plasma blast hit it next, almost breaking through the shield.

Sasha strained her striker units to the limit, but clutching an odd three hundred extra kilograms in the forms of two Witches and their strikers, even the jet strikers struggled to get her going. She would have ordered Berkut to close with the large types, but with all these new weapons, especially those sonics, trying to shadow large types to shield themselves against other Neuroi was simply asking to get your clock rung. Even if Berkut could withstand the sonics with their reinforcement, never a certain proposition, she doubted the local Witches could.

To her side, Yion, also holding a Zhongwen Witch, grabbed a heavy laser with her gravitation powers and bent it back towards the large type which fired it, smashing a smoking chasm across one wing. Behind her, the rest of Orel flight followed in hedgehog formation, projecting shields and pouring fire in all directions, sheltering a flight of local Witches. Those five at least had the mental fortitude to keep flying, but they definitely looked shaky, Sasha doubted they'd withstand high intensity combat.

Then the large types changed their behaviour, they stopped firing lasers. Projecting huge shields, they started closing in, flying over and descending onto Berkut Wing, switching weapons power back into their engines. Whilst still slow relatively speaking, their bulk made up for it.

They were trying to hem the Witches in. Smaller Neuroi closed from all direction around the large types. If they were stuck in this kind of furball, they would start taking casualties.

"Berkut! We have to gain distance, we can't sit around babysitting!" came a radio cry from Sokol.

"Berkut. Permission to drop ballast?" a request from Jastreb.

Sasha hissed as she fired a shield into a small type, shattering it. Even though she knew Nina didn't mean anything by it, it always made her blood boil to hear her talk of other humans in such a cold manner. She refused to consider that idea. She had left enough rookies dead in her wake for an eternity. Once again, she prepared to use her magic.

Sasha shouted, magically projecting her voice through all of Harbin.

"Witches! Snap out of it! Mourn later! Live now!"

They didn't share a language, but her intent was clear and projected across with her magic.

The Zhongwen Witches she clutched to her chest blinked, shaking her head, looking up in confusion at the tall Orussian Witch who held them.

Their striker units spun up again. Sasha let the two Witches go, they wobbled for a second, then stabilised. One hastily gave her a salute and said something in Zhongwen. The words were lost to the passing wind but Sasha didn't know Zhongwen anyway, so she nodded in response, hoping it was adequate encouragement.

"Berkut! Split and swing around the large bastards! Go V-Max!"

Breaking apart their protective formations, Sokol, Orel and Jastreb squadrons screamed away, outracing the large types trivially. The large types broke apart their formations and disengaged their energy intensive shields as Berkut swung around, between and under them. The local Witches stayed, turning and engaging with the smaller fliers.

Berkut had done all they could for them, and in dogfighting, the rotor model strikers were not at a huge performance disadvantage compared to jet strikers.

That is what Sasha told herself over and over again in her head as the three squadrons reformed and arced towards the fifteen ascending large types. She hoped desperately that at least one of those girls would still be alive by the time they destroyed the large types.

Ignoring formalities, the wing of veteran Witches fired directly at the cores of the large types. The whole time they have been protecting the local Witches, they had been flying north. Now the large types were clear of Harbin, hovering over the glassed, molten remains of Harbin Northern Perimeter Headquarters.

The fifteen large types manoeuvred themselves into a hedgehog formation of their own, covering each others blind spots and weaknesses.

The Golden Eagle showed no mercy, swooping down on her prey.

Behind them, the second wave of Neuroi smashed into the South Eastern defences of Harbin.

XxXxXxXxXx

Occupied by the large types, the defences of the southern Perimeter did not have the opportunity to target the strange, slow, bulky large type sized pair of Neuroi that passed through, the heavily laden units flying low and slow, depending on their escorts to pass by the human defences. The unusual units lacked the glowing red of active laser panels, causing most of the defences to concentrate on the actually shooting Neuroi.

However, flying so slowly, even the older fortifications in the southern half of the city found them easy game. One gunner took an opportunistic shot with his FLAK-33. The shell smashed into the side of one of the transports, bypassing its forwards facing shield. The Neuroi wobbled, then plunged, something important within it destroyed by the shell. It skidded over the streets, crushing houses and fleeing humans by the hundreds, leaving behind a red trail of crushed bricks and dying humans as it tumbled through the outskirts of town.

Armoured cars rushed to the scene, machine guns chattering, rounds probing over the surface, looking for laser ports or the faintly purple glow of a core. Anti-aircraft guns from nearby nests depressed, beginning to pour fire into the downed transport, cutting off chunks of hull with each shot. One armoured car ventured too close to the downed transport and a tremendous claw smashed down on it, squashing it flat.

A titanic Neuroi walker hauled itself up from the wreckage.

Standing at 40 meters tall, the four legged walker towered above the surrounding buildings. Twin weapon projectors scanned the landscape, extending sideways from a tall turret, giving the walker a centaurian appearance.

Shells from the nearby fortification impacted on its flank, their power mitigated by a flash of shielding. The walker pivoted and a searing white grew on its left lance. It's right lance stabbed out with light laser fire, targeting the slivers of gaps in the concrete armour, the individual gunports themselves, with mechanical precision. Detonations rippled through the fort, gouts of fire belching from gunports as ammunition cooked off from the laser fire.

The ultra heavy walker was not done yet however. With a howl and the nightmarish white flash, the plasma lance discharged and struck the building. The concrete structure exploded outwards with a deafening crack, cored through by the plasma blast. The top floors that remained collapsed down into the hollowed out building, burning. Houses beneath the path of plasma, next to the fortress and behind it were also blown to smithereens by the effect of the plasma on the surrounding air and the explosion of the fort. Waves of burning air roiled outwards, spreading the growing firestorm.

Another three of the Ultra Heavy walkers emerged from the wreckage and tens of thousands of Neuroi infantry scuttled between their legs, the dark river of units swarming out from the transport, which was already repairing itself. The ultra heavy walkers marched through the city, mindless of the houses and factories they trampled under feet, infantry following in their footsteps, they moved determinedly south west towards the Butcher's Nest, where the other transport was now arriving.

XxXxXxXxXx

The camp of the protesters around the Butcher's Nest was in chaos.

The civilians streamed around the perimeter fences like a great river.

At first escorted away from the facility by the Zhongwen army, they had heard the reports of Neuroi, then rushed for the shelters.

Dismayed at the sheer speed of the Neuroi advance, of the sight of full shelters and overwhelmed by psychological terror of running towards the Neuroi, the riot of humans had turned back, some scattering into the farmlands, but most ran directly for the 'Hospital', terror overwhelming revulsion as they beat upon the gates, demanding entrance.

The Fusoan forces had withdrawn into the fortress after their short skirmish with the nationalist forces, leaving the outmost fences unmanned. The gates were locked.

The bulky shape of the Neuroi transport roared forwards. The guns of the Fusoan facility thundered, hundreds of guns, tightly packed on rooftops and within the grounds, fired all they had at the advancing Neuroi.

Ourside, people milled on the grassy plain. In the open.


XxXxXxXxXx

The small Neuroi flyers screamed overhead, dozens falling to disciplined and concentrated fire from the Butcher's Nest. Training told as the fire from below smashed apart small and medium type flyers, bullets converged on Neuroi one after another, breaking apart the incoming assault one Neuroi at a time.

However, their predominantly light anti-aircraft, placed there with the original intention of shooting down Witches, barely made a mark as the massive transport flew downwards, rivalling the entire above ground complex in sheer mass. However, rather than slag the complex with lasers or blast it and surrounding plains to kingdom come with hellfire like a large type, the transport slowed and descended, looming closer and closer.

The dark mass of Neuroi hull was blotting out the sky. No training in the world could hold against that terror that the Fusoan men felt as the large type continued to skim lower. Yet they did not break, methodically directing fire, trying to find laser panels, chipping off bits of the Neuroi at a time.

For the Children of Heaven, it wasn't a matter of orders or greed. It was their life, their philosophy. Their cause and their life were one and the same, to abandon one was to forfeit the other. What they did must be done.

With that iron mindset they ran forwards towards the Neuroi as the transport slammed it's nose right into the third floor of the Butcher's Nest. Sprinting for the black mass of the Neuroi, they primed their explosive vests, even knowing that they were unlikely to cause enough damage to cause it to withdraw.

Lasers sliced out, cutting the men down. From within the large type black masses of ground Neuroi swarmed into the facility and dropped into the adjacent grounds. The gathered civilians wailed in despair at the sight, turning and running with true panic now. Flying type Neuroi sometimes ignored civilians. But the only reason land based Neuroi ever descended near a city was well known to everyone.

Complete and total extermination of human life.

More and more transports were cresting the horizon as the vanguard transport spilled out Neuroi walkers and infantry in front of the Butcher's Nest.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Listen up, I don't know who the hell you fellows are, but we are the Britannian SIS. You take that down on record if you want. We're here to rescue the prisoners held within that facility. Now I bet you have some fancy plans, but with the Neuroi here, they're probably down the dunny. Don't fret, the Neuroi reamed our plans good too."

Leona Northrop, leader of the SIS 15th Intelligence corps, stood in the edge of the cargo carriage as the train rapidly sped towards the Butcher's Nest. It was looking less and less like a place she wanted to be, property values recently taking a tremendous hit with a Neuroi large type setting itself down basically on the place. The view was also suffering something awful from pollution as Harbin city burnt.

Dressed in heritage runic armour and with a backpack strike unit equipped, she cut an impressive sight, or so she thought herself. It was also the only reason she could think of why the entire platoon of unknown men hiding hadn't come forth yet.

"Now things are rapidly going up shit creek, but we're not going to let the Neuroi of all things snatch up those poor sods after all they've been through. You've probably also planning to use this train as exfil and that's fine, should be plenty of space for everyone. So, are you fellas going to keep hanging onto the bottom of the carriage, or are you going to come up and talk like decent folk?"

XxXxXxXxXx

While the surface of the Butcher's Nest was a textbook of organised anti-Neuroi tactics as disciplined fire and choke zones stonewalled the advancing Neuroi infantry, the underground interior of the facility was an absolute mess.

Cold eyed Liberion special forces moved through the facility with lightning speed, realising they were thoroughly lost and backtracking their steps every few hundred meters. Fifty seven Indian Britannian Special Air Service in four squads each led a train of at least two hundred former prisoners through the halls. South Afrikan Witches and Gallian special forces played a game of cat and mouse through a 120 meter long submarine and its surrounding docks in an underground cave, the latter trying to convince the former they were 'on ze same burning team mademoiselle'. A few pairs of med Witches whom had escaped from their executions ran through the hallways, hunted by Fusoan Witches, young as five years old. One SIS agent wondering who the hell else attacked on the same day sprinting through the hallways.

The only thing shared between these disparate elements was that Fusoan security forces whom they met had quick ends.

Outside the facility, more Neuroi transports were reaching the outside perimeters of the facility. Fusoan armoured garrisons emerging from their underground garages to face off against the initial force of Neuroi. Armoured cars and tanks maneuvered around the concrete barriers, trading fire with the Neuroi on the front lawns and the forces advancing up the hill.

To the north, Neuroi dust was thick in the air as a group of Large types strained to hold a wing of Orussian Witches in check, large type after large type being smashed into powder despite them dedicating almost all of their energy to defence, offense and using rotational tactics.
Slightly to the south of the melee, the local garrison of Witches, bloodied but victorious, headed back south towards the city, weapons depleted, throwing regretful looks back at the still battling Orussian wing.
To the north east of the facility, a military train was rushing towards the Butcher's Nest, turrets firing up towards the any Neuroi which got too close, filled with two platoons of military men eyeing each warily even as the train came dangerously close to derailing, held onto the tracks by straining SIS Witches.
Far, far away to the north east, a Liberion Wing of Witches thundered southwards, the Liberion Flying Tigers, pushed by Lockheed P-80 Striker Units with General Electric/Allison J33 turbojet engines to super cruise at only thirty meters per second less than breaking the speed of sound three times over.

To the east, a Suomus Witch caressed the her trigger, then fired seven times, as quickly as the slide would work, the invisible bullets smashing undetected into the flank of one of the ultra heavy walkers that rampaged through south Harbin, one bullet landing after another on top of each other, digging into its armour breaking and apart its core.
Further to the east, a massive wave of transports were on approach, the slow Neuroi guarded by an additional three groups of Neuroi Sorceresses.

To the south, three divisions of Zhongwen troops rushed towards Harbin from Changchun, still hours distant, their Witches leaving the ground troops far behind, straining their rotor strikers as they raced north.

Then twenty six Neuroi Sorceresses entered the underground facility from the vanguard transport, blasting apart the resistance within the upper floors, making entrances if they couldn't find one, throwing the underground scene into further chaos.

XxXxXxXxXx

None of the chaos above and around reached Katyusha Zharkov.

She sat against a steel wall looking upwards at the ceiling lights. Expressionless.

Her face was pale and thin, eyes bloodshot, her blond hair scraggly.

She wasn't sure if she just woke up, or if she had been awake for hours now. Inside the utterly featureless room, with the 300 watt lights constantly shining down on her, there was no methods for her to track time except when they visited her.

She hadn't needed to restrained for the last week.

They knew she was now too cowardly to kill herself.

They tried all sorts things to try and induce her to recover her own magic. They lowered the ceiling of the room until she was pressed against the floor so hard that she could barely breathe, then opened a door, a sliver of light, far from where she was, trying to induce a magical reaction through claustrophobia.

They flooded the room with icy cold water until Katyusha had to stand on her tip toes, stretching and craning her neck to gasp for breathes, trying to incite a magical reaction out of her through the fear of drowning.

They had filled the room with insects, but the joke was on them that time. Katyusha had grabbed them and eaten them, ignoring the bites, glad of any variation to the gruel which was force fed to her once every several hours.

The days had blended together until they decided torturing her directly wouldn't work.

They had changed tactics, hauling Minori in and torturing her instead. Katyusha had tried to tell herself that Minori was already dead, that the person they tortured wasn't her. It didn't work, she had fallen unconscious after snapping both her wrists and thumbs out of joint.

Seemingly pleased by her strong reaction, they had repeated that method again and again.

After awakening again in the steel room for the seventh time after that, she couldn't stand it anymore and bit out her own wrists, precise in the way only a med Witch could be.

They had sent in one of the child Witches, who only worked to heal her at the same rate as she lost blood, keeping her on the edge of death. Katyusha had stared into the gulf for only a few hours, feeling death looming over her, knowing she would die the moment the child Witch stopped healing her, before she had broken down and begged. Still they did not relent. The Director returned, looking down at her, telling her to use her own magic to heal herself.

Katyusha had tried, she had tried so hard, but her magic wouldn't return no matter what.

Days later, when she had bitten off her own tongue, they had stopped the bleeding, but left her tongue still severed. Putting her into an above ground room, they then introduced two other med Witches, telling the pair that she wanted some company. They had been exhausted after tending to other victims, unable to regrow her tongue, but they had stayed with her, talking. Being unable to tell them of what they were actually doing, sitting there, restrained and mute… those two Witches were probably the pair called in to fill Minori and her own positions. She howled and sobbed, inconsolable, the other two med Witches had panicked, unable to find anything wrong other than her tongue with a delve, they had tried to ask her what was wrong. It was that which had driven her insane for a few days, trying to talk but being unable.

She absently reached into her mouth. Her tongue was back, slightly numb. The healing of the nerves was slightly clumsy.

Her hand slumped back to her side. How many of the victims that she had treated had been in a situation like what she was in now?

XxXxXxXxXx

"Pull back! Pull-!"

The soldier fell, smoking hole through his chest, the Neuroi Sorceresses flew past him, juking side to side, twitching through the air, the omnidirectional reactionless drives allowing them to move in ways no Witch could copy with their strikers. The Sorceress simply dodged most the bullets, precise shields appearing for brief seconds to deflect the stray shots.

Down the corridor, a squad of Fusoan guards rushed around the door, slamming it closed.

The Sorceress flew up the door, raising her arms. Covers slid back and white lightning crackled as plasma built then surged forwards in a shaped torch.

On the other side of the door, the men looked on in terror as the metal hissed, smoking, glowing orange, then white, sparks and dribbles of molten metal arcing off.

They looked at each other and nodded.

The Sorceress pried the door open, molten steel giving way, seeping into the next section of corridor like a nightmare.

The five men leapt for her.

Two were decapitated by a laser sweep. One was smashed in the face by the same arm that swept over the previous two men. One blasted to pieces by residual plasma, the detonation of his explosive vest rocking her just enough for the last man to latch onto her, detonating his explosive vests at point blank.

The explosions were close to a load bearing wall, the Liberion demolition charge above the door, already pushed to its limit by the heat, exploded in sympathy at the proximity detonations.

Fail deadly systems cut in as the charge sent signals down the wires that connected it to the various other Liberion demolition packs installed through the complex.

Those explosions from the Liberion explosions detonated the South Afrikan demolition charges.

Those then set off the trigger for the Britannian explosives setup by Agent 007.

XxXxXxXxXx

The explosions rippled through the complex, collapsing load bearing walls throughout. Due to the fact that most of the operatives had different ideas about exactly what they wanted to collapse with their explosives, many more of the critical load bearing walls collapsed than any of the special forces within had planned.

Only the fact that none of the factions managed install their full sets of charges saved them from having a million tons of concrete crashing down on all their heads.

The facility shook like a building possessed, several of the outlying structures collapsing outwards. The very hill Witch the Butcher's Nest perched upon shook, slumping as an induced landslide occurred.

The above ground buildings leaned heavily to the west as the underground sections shifted, dragging some sections of the underground tunnels into the air.

That was to plan. For the SIS anyway.

As the edges of the tunnels breached the ground, many of the reinforcing walls connecting the underground tunnels to the rest underground structures snapped, breaking the monolithic structure into several disparate pieces, collapsing many sections of the facility and cutting power to others, throwing great swathes of the underground tunnels into darkness.

That was not to plan. For anybody.

With an electronic pulse, Sorceress R731SV2-2 rebooted.

[Central Unit no damage]

[Beginning Repair]​

Exotic particle bleed created a shower of ultraviolet light from the Neuroi frame as it repaired itself.

[Repairs completed]
[Approximate duration: 6.5 seconds]​

Sorceress R731SV2-2 rebooted several peripheral systems. The equivalent of a human stretching some muscles.
She flipped herself upright, then consulted her gravimetric scanners.

There were no errors, she was aligned perpendicular to the gravitational field of the local planet, but the hallway itself had tilted.

She queried the local air superiority platform. It obliged with her request, sending a series of long wave radiation pulses into the ground and relaying them back.

The local planetary surface was undoing rapid sedimentary shift. Possible risk to wellbeing of local species targeted for retrieval. Recommend all possible haste with progressing of mission and the abandonment of conservation strategies.

She sent the report directly to Superior Existence A1, then continued on, heading deeper into the facility. Her sisters had already eliminated many humans deemed hostile to their objectives and secured the wellbeing of their objectives.

XxXxXxXxXx

Katyusha grimaced as the lights flickered out. Light deprivation again?

On its own, she didn't mind, taking it as an opportunity to sleep, so they combined the darkness with other things. Intermittent flashing red lights like those of the Neuroi. Broadcasting static into the room. Once, flooding it while it was still dark.

The cell door opened, letting in a sliver of light.

Katyusha snapped her eyes closed, shoving her hands over her ears. Pushing herself into the corner.

No.

Not this.

She hated this.

Of all that they could do, why this one again? Why again so soon?

She knew she'd open her eyes. She'd walk up to the door. She would hear the voices of other people chattering cheerfully. She'd try to open the door. The door wouldn't open. She'd push herself against the door, screaming through the gap for someone, anyone to hear her.

No one would come. They would, sit, out of sight, talking, laughing, living, unable to hear her. She would be trapped in the dark room, alone.

Katyusha felt herself shuddering. At this point, she'd almost prefer it if those voices returned.

No.

No. No. No.

The light from the door brightened.

It was figment of her imagination.

It was her eyes adjusting to the dark.

The moment she opened her eyes, the door would be closed again.

"Hey, can you walk?"

Katyusha started, looking up.

A large Indian man, clad in dark coloured ballistic armour, kneeled in front of her. Speaking… English maybe?

What new torture was this?

Behind him, another Indian man appeared in the open doorway, leading by her hand another- Minori.

"Minori!" Katyusha gasped, standing up.

The Indian man in her room switched to Zhongwen "Do you know her? We are Britannian um… uh. We are Britannians. We're here to help."

Was this an actual rescue effort? She took a slight step back from the Indian man.

He closed his eyes at her reaction. Lowering his voice, he remained kneeling, speaking softly, "We truly are here to help. I cannot give you proof that our intentions are… true. But, if you can walk, you are welcome to walk with us."

Standing up, the man waited, his hand extended towards her.

For a long moment, Katyusha considered staying. She felt so very tired.

False hope is better than no hope.

She walked forwards, grabbing onto his hand.

XxXxXxXxXx

Sergeant Fazal Din lead the thin young woman out of the cell and set her next to the mentally damaged girl escorted by Private Gounder, Minori apparently was her name.

Distantly a PA announcement rang out, slurred by intermittent power and damage to the internal landlines, warning of Neuroi and foreign nationals. The girl flinched at the mention of Neuroi. Sergeant Din himself felt a jolt of dread at the thought of the Black Raksha.

The 28th SAS Third squad were having a hell of a time this mission.

There were murderous Fusoan kill units, passing through the compound murdering their captives, other special operations groups inside the facility, God knows what their objectives were, and invading Neuroi, whom would no doubt be here trying to kill everyone. Third squad were down to just eleven men.

More than anything else however, third squad had a more fundamental problem. They were completely lost, forced by collapsing tunnels to take detour into one of the unmapped areas of the facility.

It was a boon in that they found another group of Witch holding cells. Fazal had seen some tearful parents reunited with their daughters, he had seen many more break down and cry at their state of their daughters. He had seen most search desperately and come away despondent.

He had seen the prisoners react so hostilely to the Fusoan girl they rescued to the extent that he had to stop them from beating the girl to death. Honestly he didn't see the point of it. They all looked the same to him in the ways that mattered. The Orussian girl just rescued was the only one who seemed glad at the sight of her.

XxXxXxXxXx

Janissary Bond ducked carefully over rubble, jogging down the corridor. Above her the lights flickered constantly, the flashing lights overwhelming even her enhanced eyes at times.

She had confirmed first, second and fourth squads were on their way to the extraction point. Third squad had seemed to have been diverted into the spiral of corridors at the facilities center, circling deeper into the facility.

Her tracker hummed almost audibly. Third squad should be near now.

The improvised dowsing rod spun rapidly. She was directly above or below third squad now.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Hawk, you sure we should be doing this?" questioned Kyte Rodin gruffly, the leader of the 106th Irregular Operations man puffing on cigar. With his tinted glasses, rough beard and lit cigar, he pulled off a great façade of unconcern, but one look at his white knuckled grip on the railing showed it to be a lie.

A nearby explosion rocked the train as a small type explosively disintegrated from a shot from the armoured carriage behind the locomotive. Hawk Actual sweated slightly as she and the other Hawks kept their hands anchored on the floor of the carriage, backpack striker units whirring at full power, making sure the train didn't derail.

"Yes! Now let me concentrate! What's our distance to Hotel Two?"

Unlatching his death grip from the railing, Kyte picked up a pair of binoculars, muttering under his breath the whole time, "Let you concentrate or tell you our distance dammit lady- We are ten and a half clicks off from Hotel Two. At our speed, we'll get there in about seven minutes or so."

Leona nodded, head bowed, magic circle under her spinning furiously.

Kyte frowned, then turned to the still unnamed and silent man standing in the locomotive with them, "How about you Ishmael? You got any thoughts about this?"

The other special operations soldier looked at him, an eyebrow raised at the nickname. 'Ishmael' humoured the other man and spoke, tone very frank, "Our chances aren't good, the building looks to have partially collapsed, travel through it will take time. Outside of complex swarming with attacking Neuroi. Top levels of complex also likely to contain large amounts of infantry Neuroi, extracting civilians in such a situation is unlikely to succeed. While it appears that human surface elements have not been wiped out, more Neuroi transports will be arriving and the forces we bring will not balance out such a disparity of power."

Kyte grunted in agreement, "Still, what to do? We knew what we signed up for."

The two men shared a short moment of comradely silence as the armoured train barrelled towards the Butcher's Nest with one hundred and fifty nervous men and eight somewhat out of their depth intelligence Witches.

The body count on top of that hill was going to rise sharply by the end of the morning, one way or another.

XxXxXxXxXx

Finally, the last of the fifteen large types over the Northern plains crashed into the ground, laser panels destroyed, internals shredded and finally core speared by a lance of ice, exploding into silvery dust on the scorched glass north east of Harbin.

"All squads, report status." commanded Sasha, taking stock of herself as she did so. Her own HS.404 was out of ammo and she had ditched the cannon to reduce her drag, but her magic still burned strong.

"Jastreb. Green. Ammo at half. Magic is still good for all flights. No casualties"

"Sokol here. Yellow. Ammo at half, no injuries but I think flights Two and Three definitely need to have breather."

"Orel reporting. Yellow. Ammunition is basically gone for flight One. HS.404 is all out. No casualties and all flights fine on magic."

Sasha nodded as she took stock of the battlefield. There were few Neuroi left over northern Harbin to their south, the local garrison were clearing out the skies of the small fliers that remained. The southern city was still in chaos, three marauding ultra heavy walkers still stomping through the tightly packed houses, Neuroi infantry following in their wake. To the east, the second force of Neuroi rained down lasers on the rapidly weakening South Eastern Perimeter fortresses, slowly working their way forwards to approach the Butcher's Nest from the east, apparently planning to link up joining with an advanced force of Neuroi already there. Human army units struggled to make their way across the few bridges that were still standing to the Southern city, trying to place themselves in the way of the inevitable Neuroi ground advance.

The human static defences across the entire city had almost all been completely destroyed, the large types that had flown over simply blanketing the city with light laser strikes, finding it impossible to miss with how dense the cityscape was on their way through. Fortresses, great gashes cut in their concrete skin, silently burnt. The civilian buildings were not in much better shape, misses from laser and plasma bursts had the entire city, both north and south sides, aflame, a howling firestorm that roared skywards like a tropical storm. Buildings, gutted by laser strikes and raging fires, leaned dangerously, one such high rise collapsed with a rumble even as she watched. Refugees, escaping from breached shelters, their clothing and hair on fire, leapt into the water of the Songhua river.

Sasha bit her lips. The local garrisons here were too light. No doubt that reinforcements would be arriving soon, probably advanced Witch wings would be here in the next ten minutes, but Strike Witches were air superiority platforms. Trained from the ground up to engage singular, powerful enemies. They were unsuited for prolonged engagement with large masses of the regenerating Neuroi. Even Tank Witches only carried so much ammo.

There were very few Witches whom had the magical strength to fight head to head with large Neuroi types once the force multiplier of weaponry was exhausted. Sasha estimated that one fifth of such Witches currently in Zhong Guo were probably flying next to her in her Wing.

"Sokol Two, Sokol Three, replenish Orel's ammunition with what you have then set down for the moment. Help with firefighting in northern Harbin then move to southern Harbin, clearing any ground units you see. If you see abandoned weapons, feel free to police them. Make sure to try to restore as much of your magic reserves as possible. Sokol One, fold up into Orel Squadron and Sokol Four, fold into Jastreb."

The two flights of Witches nodded to her in affirmation, the roar of jet engines winding down as they conserved their magic, gliding with just turbine power. Handing over their ammunition and guns to Orel squadron, Sokol Two and Three descended towards the ground. Alexis's flight, Sokol One, moved forwards Orel Squadron as Sokol flight Four merged with Jastreb, the flights temporarily joining in with the other squadrons until their two other flights were recalled to reform Sokol Squadron.

"Berkut, we clear the northern skies, then take down those walkers."

The Wing reformed, slightly uneven at the missing Witches, and burned south back towards the Neuroi.

XxXxXxXxXx

The information that flowed across a Neuroi network was overwhelming. Every second, more than an exabit of information was exchanged between the various individual existences upon Earth that were collectively known to humanity as 'Neuroi'. While most of these one hundred or so petabytes that were exchanged across the Neuroi Net every second were useless for combat operations, consisting of data validation, up to one fifth of information consisted of useful information such as relative positions, status of individual and group units and of environmental conditions.

It was incomparably greater compared to the human language, which comprised of approximately five to six bits per word, at a best a pace of perhaps two hundred words per minute and only between only pairs of individual humans for an information exchange rate of maybe twenty bits per second. With only two billion, two hundred million humans alive at any given moment, sum total human information exchange rate at absolute possible maximum sat at around 24 gigabits.

Against the Neuroi, the difference in information exchange was over seven orders of magnitude.

This sheer disparity of information exchange was put on ruthless display by the Neuroi as the force from the crashed transport smashed through Southern Harbin and its military like a tsunami.

Twenty three men died within a single second to the nine infantry bots and five small type fliers that blitzed them, the Neuroi whom killed them unlinked the next second, as much as Neuroi could unlink, returning to their own tasks.

The Neuroi knew where the humans were and in which direction they were facing. The Neuroi knew what arms the humans carried. The Neuroi knew in which of the men presented the greatest threats. The Neuroi knew in which order the men had to die. The Neuroi knew which men they individually would kill and in which order they need to do it in.

The humans did not even know that Neuroi were near them.

One Neuroi infantry walker will handily outfight a single conscript, but fall to three. Ten Neuroi infantry walkers will handily slaughter twenty conscripts but fall to forty. As Neuroi density within an area increases, networked intelligence and networked computing increases their battle ability exponentially.

In a vacuum, the twenty thousand infantry walkers currently in southern Harbin following the three remaining ultra heavy walkers could fight evenly with a human conscript infantry force ten times their size inside an urban environment.

The total population of Harbin, military and civilian, barely breaks two hundred thousand.

Of course, there were armoured battalions and fortifications, but such meant little when the Neuroi currently had fliers of all designations, Medium walkers and another twenty thousand infantry walkers currently disembarking at the Butcher's Nest.

There was only a single unit that for the longest time remained the trump to the Neuroi within humanities battle paradigm.

Now, with such improvements to the Neuroi units, the Witches, formerly the absolute trump, no longer stood supreme.

XxXxXxXxXx

Fazal frowned as the mass of humans advanced towards an intersection.

A chill developed in his gut. Instincts screamed at him.

He held up his fist. The two hundred odd humans behind him didn't all know military sign language, but they all got the message, the front ranks shrinking back as the seven vanguards of third squad moved forwards slowly, covering each other and maintaining spacing.

Something ahead tinkled lightly, metal lightly hitting metal echoing through the silence of the corridor. Fazal momentarily felt a shiver of dread sweep over him, someone had just stepped over his grave.

Shaking it off, Fazal counted down on his fingers.

Fazal and Gupta spun around the left and right corners pressed tight against the walls, another pair of men aimed over their shoulders. The three remaining men hung back, covering them from a distance.

Fazal frowned, scanning down the lengths of corridor.

The lights flickered out.

A slight rattle above him.

The lights flickered on.

Something was running on the lights.

A blur of motion.

Fazal ducked in time. Gupta was not so lucky.

Five tiny Witches dropped from the ceiling. A knife rammed right through the base of Gupta's neck, cutting the man's spine.

A blade whistled over Fazal's neck as he rolled, giving him the closest shave of his life.

Gounder and Singh Dhillon fired, sub machine gun rounds flying. Kishore leapt back, submachine gun crushed to pieces, drawing his sword.

Saldanha fell, a handle protruding from his forehead. Sadanrunghani winced as he blocked a knife with his forearm.

Fazal completed his roll coming to his feet, levelling his gun. Suhdarson fell to the ground, eyes unfocusing as blood sprayed from his throat.

The other six men of the SAS vanguard were dead.

A samurai sword slammed through Fazal's heart, impaling him from behind.

'Yamada' walked over his collapsing body, shouldering a flamethrower.

"Grab those first two," he gestured to the two Orussian and Fusoan girls, levelling the flamethrower, "dispose of the rest."

The four men of the SAS rear guard were running up, but the prisoners were in the way.

Parents formed a solid wall, spreading their arms. Their daughters pushed past them, those who could walk, all emaciated, sick, missing limbs. They still flared their magic as they prepared to die fighting. The small Fusoan Witches casually unlimbered submachine guns now that stealth wasn't of importance.

He wouldn't allow this.

A heat built up in his stomach.

It exploded from his throat in a roar as Sergeant Fazal Din pushed himself up, magic coursing through him.

Grabbing the samurai sword protruding from his front, he broke off the blade with his hand and charged.

The man turned and gentle warmth washed over Fazal. Hah, like a little heat was going to stop him, it was nothing compared to the inferno that raged within.

He swung. The captured blade cut through shoulder, chest, arms and through the flamethrower.

One of the small Witches pounced at him. He swung again.

The Witch blinked, wide eyed in confusion as he cut through shield, through reinforced flesh, and through reinforced bones.

The other Witches peppered him with bullets. He brandished the blade, cutting a few out of the air, but most found their marks, burying themselves into his body. It was pity that he didn't have his Kirpan here, otherwise he'd show these underage brats what real swordsmanship was like.

He tried charging forwards, but his body felt slow, clumsy, the heat from within diminishing.

Then Janissary was there.

Two Fusoan Witches fell with a bullet through each eye. Another threw a knife, then barely moved her throwing hand in time to block the same knife with her palm as it returned, two red holes appearing over her heart and one through her forehead. The last fired, a long stream of accurate submachine gun fire chasing the Britannian Agent.

Janissary seemed to disperse in midair, outline becoming indistinct, filling the whole hallway. Shadows blurred through the air and Agent 007 reappeared behind the Fusoan Witch, whose temple seemed to explode outwards and three bullets raced through her skull simultaneously from different directions.

Fazal laughed, long and loud, in relief and triumph. If she was here, the prisoners would be alright, "Haha! I saw you move this time Jans you slippery woman! Bilgrami owes me big money now!"

She turned to him, face troubled, "Sergeant…"

Fazal grinned broadly, saluting her with a flourish of his stolen blade, "Special Air Services, twenty eighth platoon, third squad reporting. We've secured the prisoners."

Sergeant Fazal Din died standing, his body burning slowly in the underground tunnels of the Butcher's Nest.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Berkut, more Neuroi. Eyes on Sorceresses escorting transports to the east. I count sixteen, that is one six."

Sasha turned, confirming herself. Still to the east of the City, a huge fleet of Neuroi transports were approaching in a conga line, the large types and swarms of lesser Neuroi that were already over the southern city drawing back to meet them on their way. The current escorts for the transport seemed thin at first glance, but the Neuroi Sorceresses flying alongside them represented a greater threat than any other group of Neuroi to the human Witches.

The few Neuroi still in the Southern city rapidly disengaged, fleeing further south to join with the bulk of Neuroi forces.

Sasha realised with a sinking sensation that meaningful interception of the transports was going to be impossible. Berkut Wing, even missing two flights, outnumbered the Sorceresses more than two to one, but that mattered little when there were so many other Neuroi around and the only meaningful forces with Berkut were the remanning local Witches.

Below her, the local garrison of Witches, around two squadrons in strength, formed up and started buzzing for the south.

"Foolish. They will die," muttered Jastreb.

"Berkut, we can't let them jump into that alone, let's support them." demanded Orel, Yion's voice far too eager for someone about to fly into a swarm of Neuroi.

It was a sight that Sasha had seen over and over, local forces, unwilling to abandon their homes, holding onto positions stubbornly even against all logic. They were always the first to die. Half a year past, Berkut Wing would have pulled in with them, confident that they would win. Half a year past.

"Berkut, reel them in!" ordered Sasha. Maybe she could make those girls see sense.

The Orussian Witches swooped down, hovering in the path of the Zhongwen Witches, holding up their hands in the universal halt gesture. Most pulled up, hesitant. One Witch, the squadron leader from her position, dodged past Ulyana and Alexis, showing an impressive flying ability. Sasha herself swooped in and pulled her over.

"Wait!" snapped Sasha, grabbing the Zhongwen Witch by the arm, "Going there is-."

The other Witch suddenly lashed out with a wild punch. Surprised and in an awkward position, Sasha couldn't dodge the punch completely in time, taking it on the cheek. Sasha winced, that was going to hurt. Sure enough, the other Witch pulled her hand back with a cry of pain, knuckles bruised and bleeding, bones obviously broken.

Sasha quickly waved over Sofia, one of Orel Squadron's healers, whom also spoke some Zhongwen.

As the healer reset the bone and healed it, she asked in awkward Zhongwen, "Weisheme ni yao qu nali?"

The local Witch looked down at her hand, back up, then babbled, "Wo de meimei gei Ribenren zai Chufu de Wo guan zai limien, he wo de fumu dou zai xia bien de kangyi zhangpeng qu!"

Looking at Sasha, eyes slightly crossed from translating the rapid Zhongwen, Sofia said, "Uh- I think her little sister is held in the Butcher's Nest and her parents are within that protest camp."

A heavy ball of dull anger built in Sasha's stomach. So the news of what was going on in this city was true after all. Sasha had intellectually understood it, but hearing it right from one of the victims, even a peripheral one…

Sasha looked down to the south, biting her lips, the people from the camp had finally cleared from the lands immediately surrounding the Butcher's Nest. Fleeing from the plains, the civilians were running into the surrounding suburbs. However, the remaining Neuroi force from the crashed transports were still fanning out through the City, the light units not even bothering to make pot shots at the Witches above. A train, driven by the insane or suffering a breakdown in their breaks, basically raced the rest of the Neuroi towards the Butcher's Nest.

Save all of those within the Butcher's Nest and those in the southern city. Impossible.

Save all of those either within the Butcher's Nest or in the southern city. Impossible.

Save some of those within the Butcher's Nest and some from the Southern city. Doable.

A semblance of a plan came to mind.

Sasha

Sasha blinked, then closed her eyes, "Berkut Wing, hold."

Irina. Are reinforcements imminent? We're heavily outmatched here.

Sasha, we've got nothing else in range, Zhongwen and Liberion troops are coming in from the North and South but I'm not here to tell you that. Sasha, I have orders from Marshalrodavoisk Novikov. Direct from the Throne. Berkut Wing is to repel the Neuroi attack upon Harbin City Hospital until evacuation of Hospital staff is completed at any and all costs.

Irina. You better not be telling me that my orders are to re-enact the 'Triumph' of Sevastopol.

Sasha, I'm sorry. Any and all costs.

Irina. I'm not going to throw away the lives of my girls without reason. Why? Are we involved in the Fusoan disgrace within this city?

Silence answered her. Irina Azzamasskaia had disconnected. Or simply refused to answer. It answered her question either way.

So Berkut Wing really were here to support the Butcher's Nest. Silent condonement of the disgusting acts within Harbin from Orussia. The dull anger sharpened into a red hot rage for an instant.

Sasha took a steadying breath as she opened her eyes, thinking over her orders.

She would do it. But for those unjustly imprisoned within the Butcher's Nest, not for those people in charge of the disgrace. Some changes to her plan would be needed.

"Sofia, tell her Berkut will be supporting the local Witches. Relay my plan please." the other Orussian nodded, smiling wryly as she prepared to put her rather poor Zhongwen to use.

"Berkut, we cannot directly contest the Neuroi force en-route to the South city. We will head out and attempt to rescue the inmates of The Butcher's Nest. Sokol will reform and join in with the local Witches in clearing a path through the Neuroi ground forces in the southern city to allows the civilians formerly within the camp clear passage away from the front of fighting."

Alexis nodded, tilting her head slightly as she softly spoke to Sokol flights Two and Three, calling a rendezvous.

"Jastreb will perform soft interception of the Neuroi transports, maximum range zoom and boom harassment only. I'm counting on you Nina, keep them all safe."

Nina sighed, and the Night Witch simply gave her a thumbs up.

"Orel, we will assault the Neuroi at the Butcher's nest directly."

Yion nodded along with the rest of Orel.

"Depending on close the Neuroi are, time we have will change, but I doubt we will get more than five minutes, that means you go in, search for a maximum of one hundred and fifty seconds, and you come out. Try to conserve magic, there's no guarantee the elevated rail will remain in working order so after we load the train, we may need to carry it away from the Butcher's Nest."

Sasha took a deep breath, this was extremely risky, if the transport force and escorts arrived and deployed while Orel was still inside the compound, if the Sorceresses went all out in chasing Jastreb, if the exhausted Sokol flights were grounded by magical depletion in an urban battle against the Neuroi infantry… "Berkut, all copy?"
"Jastreb, copy."
"Sokol here, we and the local Witches copy."
"Orel reporting, we copy Wing Commander."

"Berkut, move out!"

Sokol flights One and Four dropped down towards the city with the local Witches , points of jet exhaust beneath them showing Sokol flights Two and Three on the way to rendezvous. The squadron leader of the local Witches turned and pointed at Sasha, shouting something, once again lost to the roar of her jet strikers and the wind, what filtered through lost on the mono-linguist Witch. Sasha nodded solemnly, not sure to what she agreed on.

Jastreb burned right for the incoming transports, the blue lights of their exhaust looking like stars on the backdrop of the black of the mass of Neuroi.

Orel Squadron flew right for the Butcher's Nest.

"Orel Three Lead to Berkut, that local Witch? She was saying she trusts you to rescue her sister."

Sasha felt a shiver run through her at Sofia's words, "By God and Nation I pray we succeed."

XxXxXxXxXx

Lietenent Gurung sprinted forwards with three others of SAS 28th first squad, the vanguard only making the slightest checks at corners. The hallways had been damaged by the disparate sets of demolition charges and sections of the ceiling had collapsed, letting in dark soil into the white hallways, there could be people waiting around every shadow, but it was a risk Havildar was willing to take.

They were already behind schedule, and now Neuroi invading the complex? The PA announcements had been scratchy ever since the charges had set off, but he was sure he heard the PA speak of a Neuroi force, headed by two dozen Sorceresses, invading the lower levels. If the Neuroi of all things found them, the prisoners were beyond fucked. Neuroi ground forces never left anything alive in their wake, not the people, not the animals, not even the plants. Where the Neuroi went, scorched Earth followed.

"Distance?" he shouted back to the main party.

"Three hundred meters, turn right at intersection, then one left turn!" came the reply from Ekagra. The main force moved much slower, the incline in the hallways, the unsteady lights and the general health of the prisoners mixed in with the occasional pool of blood from a body making the step difficult.

Ahead at the intersection, he saw three men dart around a corner. Havildar gripped his trigger guard hard for a instant before relaxing, it was the men of squad Two.

"Richard of York-?" he shouted the call just in case.
"Gave Battle in Vain! Bloody good to see you Gurung!" came the counter call.

Reaching the corner, Havildar looked over and saw men of Squads Two and Four.

However, Sergeant Din and his squad were missing.

Where were all the men of Squad three?

… No, he'll trust Fazal. Squad Three would catch up, but first, he had to save those with him.

"We move for the surfaced tunnels, 28th! Form up!"

XxXxXxXxXx

"Squad Four, charges set!"

This was it. Neuroi or not, the SAS 28th were going to breach the tunnels and open a path, hopefully to the surface.

"Squad Two, charges set!"

Havildar checked his squad's set of charges. The shaped explosives should blast the concrete walls outwards and hopefully open a path directly in sight of the rail line.

"Squad One, charges set! Civilians clear?" he shouted, turning back down the corridor.

"Civilians clear Gurung!" came the reply.

He shifted his sleeve, looking at his wristwatch, counting down the seconds, "Squads, countdown! Twenty!"

Berkut squadron destroys the last large type over Northern Harbin.

"Fifteen!"

Sergeant Fazal Din dies, holding his salute, those he protected giving him slight bows as they hurry past his body.

"Five!"

The train is still four minutes away.

"Mark!"

A repressed thump, a momentary sensation of breathlessness as a wave overpressure passed by.

Sunlight. The steady, gentle light of dawn.

Oil smoke.

Lasers.

Bullets.

XxXxXxXxXx

The outside of the complex was a charnel house.

The Fusoan forces had finally been broken by the implacable Neuroi advance. Burning armoured vehicles lay everywhere, pouring out thick oil smoke. Pillboxes were quiescent, their tough skin bypassed by lasers that sought out their embrasures, guns sitting silently as a monument to their dead wielders. Anti-aircraft turrets occasionally still chattered, but their volume of fire was thin, especially in the face of the growing numbers of aerial Neuroi. The sharp reports of lighter infantry weapons still echoed through the haze and the red glow of Neuroi lasers was omnipresent.

The Fusoans still fought, they were incapable of anything else, but organised resistance had broken down.

A sharp crack rang out across the grounds and concrete dust poured from one of the lengths of tunnel that currently stuck out from the ground. The Neuroi paused, investigating the phenomenon.

That is how Lieutenant Havildar Lachhiman Gurung found himself face to face with a Neuroi infantry bot.

He snapped up his submachine gun, rounds slamming into the Infantry drone. Two flattened themselves against a magic shield -What by Shiva, Brahma and Kali?!- and the rest smashed into the infantry unit, sending it sprawling back, glowed silver, then exploding into Neuroi dust as a lucky bullet found the core.

He searched the grounds once, the train wasn't here yet. Stepping back into the tunnels Havildar, gestured to the SAS, they formed a solid defensive line across the front of the refugees. He tapped his radio and got nothing but static, a reality most resigned themselves to now on battlefields with the Neuroi.

This was bad. There was a delay. Where had the discrepancy appeared from?

The fact finally came to the forefront of his mind. Of course, someone else, likely one of the other special operations groups had set off the alarm and demolition charges early, likely with an unintentional chain reaction and now their mission countdown had been offset by those false starts.

He had been hurrying the operation too…

They would have to hold out until the train arrived.

Havildar felt a ball of nerves form in his stomach. Sitting here, waiting for the enemy to come to them, on their terms, was not something the Special Air Service did. They were meant to attack, to dictate the battle and have the freedom to disengage as needed. The prisoners were spread so numerous that there were at least five separate corridor intersections the 28th SAS needed to cover. By breaching the tunnel early, the 28th SAS had just opened another front against themselves, the Fusoan kill teams could already approach from behind, now Neuroi could enter the tunnels directly from their breech.

"Men, we're in somewhat of sticky situation. Prepare for close quarters battle. We need to buy at least three minutes." said the Lieutenant.

After his very short speech, Gurung hacked slightly and uncoiled his Urumi from his windpipe, winding it around his waist. He wasn't such a romantic to believe his skill was such that a melee weapon could surpass an automatic gun and the tyrant of distance, nor was he young enough to be gulled into believing the trash that weapons smiths use some Neuroi wonder material to create unbreakable weapons and thusly melee weapons having no ammunition restrictions like a gun. However, he was also well aware that in the downtimes of ranged weapon, if one jammed, if one needed a reload, if one round misfired, then a secondary may well save his life.

The 28th SAS hastily set themselves up and waited for the hammer to drop.

The forces around them did not make them wait long.

XxXxXxXxXx

The first first to come were a force from the breached exit of the tunnel within twenty seconds of the explosion as the SAS were still setting up their defensive positions. To Havildar's surprise, it was not Neuroi whom entered, but Fusoan soldiers.

They staggered into the tunnel, then blinked in surprise at the sight of the 28th SAS fortified at the intersection, weapons raised but not levelled, a wordless warning. The men at that side of the tunnel had targets they considered more important to use their ammunition on.

The Fusoan soldiers raised their rifles anyway. Not one had drawn a bead when a precise shot to each of their heads dropped them.

Soon, that which they had been running from entered, a troop of Neuroi Infantry Walkers, the special forces didn't wait this time, opening fire at center mass immediately. Shields snappped into existence and the infantry bots fell- no, ducked and rapidly crabbed away from the kill zone. The Indian Soldiers exchanged questioning looks. Strange. Usually the Neuroi didn't simply retreat like that.

The wall to the side of the hallway started glowing. They ducked just in time as the wall exploded inwards, shards of concrete ricocheting off the walls and digging themselves into the ballistics armour of the men.

A medium walker smashed through the wall and ceiling, leering down at them with laser projectors. 9mm fire splattered off its shield and the Neuroi returned fire, spearing three men on lasers. Steam and bloody mist exploded down the hallway as the men exploded from the directs laser strikes.

Grenades rolled to its feet and the Neuroi medium walker hopped back, pushing itself with one leg, the other raising to shield it's core. The grenades detonated with a tremendous bang, amplified by the confined quarters and severed one leg of the bipedal Neuroi medium walker. The men at the barricade stood to run to the next position.

As they turned, lasers lanced into their backs, the Neuroi infantry whom had retreated earlier returning, precise shots drilling themselves into the base of the neck, between the helmet and the ballistic vest, decapitating the Indian soldiers with singular shots.

Stepping forward however, they triggered the tripwires rigged to the explosive vests of the dead Fusoan soldiers. Explosions ripped through their ranks, destroying five of the Neuroi bots.

On the other side of the tunnels at the barricades facing inwards to the facility, things were almost completely quiet. Havildar thought he had seen movement down the corridor several times, yet each time he searched for it, it turned out to be nothing. Of course, that meant something was there, most likely a Witch watching them, but if she wasn't approaching, he was not going to overthrow the current status quo.

Then Neuroi appeared. A pair of Neuroi infantry walkers. Bullet slammed through the shield of the first, but it darted aside before anything vital was struck. The second withdrew and stuck it's laser cannon around the corner. Havildar thought it was firing blind until a laser strike swept over the men beside him. Before he could react, a second burst of laser fire drilled into his chest.

Nathani fell back, a band of flesh across his face charred black, growling in barely suppressed agony. Van Der Kumar clutched at his neck for a moment, blood spilling around his fingers, before toppling, dead. Havildar himself was much luckier, taking a strike directly to his chest armour. The laser strike felt like a sledgehammer hit, something he'd actually experienced, to the chest even through the armour. He ripped the latches apart in panic and threw off the melting ballistics armour, the cloth edging catching fire from the heat of the plate.

Nathani wheezed in pain beside him, Havildar turned and swore at the sight. Nathani had both eyes burnt out, the charred tissue extending back to his ears and down to the bridge of his nose, "That bad sir?"

"Yes, you will need medical help." said Havildar. Shoving his submachine gun over the barricade, Havildar fired two bursts wildly then swung up, scanning. A Neuroi was leaning over the corner and as soon as he stood up, another laser struck him, this time on the back plate he hugged to his chest. His ballistic armour saved him once already and the well made armour once again came through, the laser tearing into but not breaching the back plate. He steadily held down the trigger and was rewarded by a blast of Neuroi dust as one of the two infantry bots disintegrated.

Keeping his finger on the trigger, Havildar plucked a grenade from his belt and threw it. Halfway there, the other Neuroi stepped out from behind the wall just as his last bullet whistled past, then shot the grenade from mid-air. Havildar was halfway back into cover so it didn't do anything but cause his ears to ring briefly, but how had the Neuroi known when to step out? Was it counting his bullets?

However, much worse was the fact that Neuroi were emerging from within the facility. From the scale of the facility, there were probably at least a thousand prisoners that the 28th SAS had not managed to rescue, if the Neuroi were arriving from within the deeper levels of the facility, that painted a grim picture for any humans whom remained inside the facility, regardless of their allegiance. That of course, included SAS 3rd squad and any prisoners they had managed to liberate.

"Sir, give me your remaining grenade," muttered Nathani. The man had already taken his belt bandolier off, laying in his lap, unlatching his ballistic plates also. Havildar hesitated for a brief moment, but it wasn't just the lives of his men at stake here, if the Neuroi broke through the prisoners they had worked to free would also die.

"Good luck, I won't come back, so make sure you pull those pins soldier." Havildar gave the single remaining grenade he had, taking the ballistics plates in return, then searched around the corner with a mirror, before he moved away to the next position.

Behind him, Nathani swung a tired salute, "You can rely on me sir."

XxXxXxXxXx

At the other end of the barricades, towards the breach in the tunnels, it was pure pandemonium. Neuroi infantry bots swarmed inside the facility, the Medium type Walker behind them suppressing any possible response from the SAS light infantry. The mass of nearly forty bots paused before an intersection, then a single Neuroi walker ran forward. A click sounded as booby traps set off, blowing it apart. Before the smoke even cleared, more Neuroi poured around the corner, lasers lashing out at the SAS, their positions marked by the first infantry bot as it died.

Men were cut down, lasers now aimed at their arms and legs when shots to the throat and face were impossible, the limbs bereft of the laser resistant ballistics plating. Damaged Neuroi fell back, drifting to rear of the ranks with co-ordination that would be the envy of an Olympic cyclist team, ranks of its fellows providing the world's best ablative armour as those in rear regenerated. Wherever the Neuroi came under fire from, their return fire was perfect, lasers missing their comrades by millimetres. In situations where even the best trained human soldiers would not fire for hesitation of striking friendlies, the Neuroi infantry walkers fired freely, co-ordinating with each other to provide omnidirectional coverage and perfect lanes of fire in all situations.

XxXxXxXxXx

Lieutenant Havildar sprinted towards the tunnel entrances, past the nervous looking prisoners. Even though they knew that the Neuroi were in front of them, the dread of the cells and facilities behind them pushed them to stay. They would all rather die than return.

Clearing past the prisoners, Havildar started finding his men, standing at their posts, checking around the corners with mirrors. But there was not a single injured trooper. From the detonations he'd heard, it sounded like his men were taking an absolute beating, traps after traps activating at a rate that meant they were not slowing the Neuroi at all. If there were no injured here, that simply meant no one had managed to retreat. From the grim looks on the faces of the other troopers, they all understood that as well.

Everybody inside the corridor stumbled as the entire structure seemed to shift, causing the watchman at the corner to drop his mirror, he didn't lean out into the corridor to retrieve it, simply plucking another from a pocket. There was no rumble of noise, so whatever it was, it wasn't a detonation. What could have caused such a heavy structure such as this, unstable as it was, to shake so violently?

The walls cracked.

Before Havildar could even think of ordering his men back, the ceiling lifted away, held in one piece by a huge shield.

Above them, the single Ultra Heavy walker that had been on the first transport loomed, the tip of turret rising forty meters above their heads, light laser ports on its limbs glowing.

Throwing aside the thousands of tons of soil and concrete with its shield negligently, the ultra heavy ponderously leaned downwards.

Havildar grabbed a grenade, as hopeless a proposition as it was, and the large type seemed to pulse.

Agony.

He couldn't move.

He couldn't breath.

His heart seized within his chest.

Neuroi organic suppressor waves. Havildar's vision darkened as blood flow to his brain ceased, unable to even blink, his heart fluttering like a dying bird inside his chest, trying to pump blood but unable to.

The Ultra heavy walker large type seemed to consider the tiny humans beneath it, a collector examining his pinned butterfly collection, then dismissed them as unimportant, firing light lasers from its limbs. An antipersonnel laser burnt right through Havildar's chest, burning past both plates of ballistics armour and into the concrete floor behind him, past that, and deeper into the facility after that.

Around him, his men suffered the same fate. Morsels of meat skewered on laser spits, the fifteen men were struck simultaneously. Even though they were already dead, they could not fall, the suppressor waves washing over their bodies, forcing them to stand. Havildar couldn't see anymore, only a brief sensation of heat from the cavity of his chest registering on his senses.

For a moment he felt weightless as the suppressor waves ceased, finally allowing him to fall to the ground.

So this was it.

The 28th SAS wiped out. Harbin, destroyed. The prisoners they worked to rescue slaughtered by the Neuroi.

The heat from his missing heart grew and grew.

No, anything but that, those people did not deserve such an end after coming so close to freedom.

His vision snapped back. Lieutenant Havildar leapt to his feet. The fifteen remaining men of SAS second and fourth squads rose with him and as one, they roared, a primeval sound, a howl of defiance.

Bullets rakes across the wave of Infantry bots. Whereas before three bullets were needed to break the shields and another two directly over the core were required to kill one, now, singular bullets smashed through the shields and explosively connected with the Neuroi infantry, shattering them. His Urumi snaked, out, the steel whips cutting through Neuroi, shields and all, in a single stroke regardless of their type, the medium walkers falling as easily as infantry, he even managed to pluck a careless small flier out of the air.

Havildar had never felt so good in his entire life.

The Neuroi were changing their tactics, rather than fire lasers center mass, they fired at limbs, cutting off the humans means to move.

His didn't care that his legs were severed at the knees, he ran along just fine as if he still had them, the golden light rolling off him forming a ghostly outline of his missing limbs. Magic.
He didn't care that gun fired, cycling its chamber over and over again despite having no ammo in the magazine, the golden bullets hit far harder than any gun he'd used previous. Magic.
He didn't care that everything else, from the Neuroi to their bullets, seemed to move so very slowly, as if they were struggling though molasses, yet he and his men weren't affected. Magic.

Sprinting and leaping at a Neuroi medium walker, he bodily rammed it, smashing through its shield, slamming it backwards into another medium walker, toppling both. Shoving his gun into the crater he left on the first he fired, golden explosions running through the frames of both as they explosively disintegrated into Neuroi dust.

Was this what it was like to be Witch?

His men seemed of one mind as they turned to the Ultra Heavy Walker, having cleared all the other Neuroi in the rail courtyard. Ignoring the lasers, they ran at it, clambering up its legs, explosions following in their wake.

Laser bloomed out, completely annihilating some of the men down to the last atom. The disappeared, wisps in the wind.

The survivors leapt on the back of the giant centaurian walker, cutting and smashing downwards into the black Neuroi carapace, ripping away armour with bullets, swords and their bare hands, looking to destroy important systems, maybe even the core.

The Ultra Heavy spun, facing it's primary lances down at the men whom tormented it. White lightning flickered.

Plasma blew outwards like a torch, burning tons of it's own hull, but also the men whom clung to it.

Havildar was blown backwards by the stream of plasma, landing back down on courtyard. All around him, the plants that remained burst into flame at the radiant heat for brief moments before the lack of oxygen in the air smothered the fires. Winds howled through the courtyard, one powerful stream blasting out from the exposed tunnel as air was sucked towards the twister of plasma that briefly formed.

He had to kill the giant walker before it killed the people inside the tunnels through suffocation, but his body felt weak, light, like it would fall apart. Despite the flames all around him, Havildar felt cold. He looked and realised why, not a trace of his body remained, only brief golden outlines, growing dimmer by the second.

The ultra heavy walker strode out of the fire, each step shaking the ground, glimmering as it regenerated its destroyed sections.

Then with a crack, blue bolts of lightning impacted with it, lifting the nineteen thousand ton walker right into the air. The magic crackled across the ground, blowing away the smoke and dust, so powerful and dense that Havildar could practically taste it.

Cannon fire and offensive shields smashed through Neuroi armour, amputating limbs as the ultra heavy tumbled, leaving huge clouds of Neuroi dust in its wake. Reduced to just a rolling chassis, rounds slammed into its core and the remains of the ultra heavy exploded.

The Witches, for they could be nothing else, pulled up into the air, rounds streaking downwards to slam down on Neuroi ground forces.

A horn blared along with the thunder of a diesel engine train. The evacuation train was here.

Lieutenant Havildar closed his eyes, his spirit fading away as the magic sustaining it depleted.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Thirty seconds!" bellowed Kyte as his brand new Orussian Avtomat Kalashnikova rifle kicked against his shoulder, spitting rounds at the Neuroi downrange.

Ahead, the dangerously leaning Butcher's Nest was still heavily contested, the sustained red glow of lasers smouldered and the yellow flashes of gunpowder weapons answering.

The train was on final approach, rail tracks now a straight run up to the complex. The thick metal gates in front of the complex were still closed, but that's why they were in a military train.

Rather than use brakes, they would use the gate to bleed off their speed then rely on the Hawks again to control what speed they had left. Ducking down to change out his magazine, he shot the Hawks a questioning look.

The women were panting, but none had passed out.

Leona noticed his questioning looks and waved her hand, "We can do it, but those gates better be tough, or we'll all be on the floor after reeling this fish in."

Kyte shook his head and popped back up, firing his rifle through the slits on the locomotive carriage armour. His rounds pitted the surface of an approaching medium type ineffectually.

A thunderous boom shook the train as a flight of Witches with jet strikers passed meters over the train, rattling the roof with their blue jet exhaust, clearing away the flying Neuroi harassing them with accurate magic enhanced cannon fire. In a split second, they were past the train and over the wall of the Butcher's Nest, disappearing from sight. Silver flashes and Neuroi dust exploding into the air from beyond the complex wall told everybody exactly what had happened out of sight however.

Kyte slowly closed his slack mouth. Next to him, Ishmael did the same.

"Who the hell were they? Your girls?"

Ishmael shook his head, "No. Fusoan I guess."

If there was one thing good to say about these Fusoans, they sure are fucking stubborn.

A stream of bullets from a machine gun nest sprayed the front of their train, bullet flattening themselves against thick alloyed armour, and continued tracking them until a Neuroi laser from the side cut it off.

Alright, never mind that, fuck the Fusoans. It was one thing that was annoying as hell about these Fusoans, they sure are fucking stubborn.

"Ten seconds to gate!"

Next to him, the other Platoon leader leaned on the whistle, the train horn blasting out a warning and a signal for their respective teams within the complex, the loudest warning they could give with the jamming.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Orel squadron, we flyby the train, destroying the harassing Neuroi, then split into your flights. One and Two will circle the perimeter, picking off Neuroi within the grounds. Conserve ammo and don't bother with the transport, it'll have offloaded its entire load by now. We probably won't have time to replenish until after we leave here. Flights Three and Four, enter the facility, search for prisoners. After clearing the immediate surroundings, Orel One and Two will follow you. Remember Orel, one hundred and fifty seconds is all you get!"

Sasha listened over the radio as Yion put forth a plan of action, there was no need for her to dictate the nitty gritty to Yion and the plan sounded solid. She almost interjected by habit however, she had been the Squadron Leader of Orel Squadron for a long time and honestly preferred it over being Wing Commander of Berkut Wing.

"Orel, all copy?"
"Orel Two Lead copies."
"Orel Three copies."
"Orel Four. I copy."
"Alri-"
"Berkut copies Orel Lead."
"Ah- um, Orel! Move out!"

There was an uncomfortable silence from Yion. Sasha wished the other girl got over her slight hero worship soon. She was a powerful Witch with a magic speciality that was far more combat applicable than Sasha's own in addition to being a morally upright and ethical human, whom cared deeply for all the other Witches in Berkut Wing.

While Sasha's raw magical power still dwarfed Yion's, she would be reaching the end of her rope. In fact, even right now she was an outlier of the outliers, retaining raw magic power that placed her within the top ten of serving Strike Witches in the world despite being as old as the two youngest Witches on that list combined at twenty two years of age.

She could lose her magic practically any day.

There had actually been a running betting pool, at least three years old, in the 1st Air Assault group of when exactly she would lose her magic. When Sasha had found out, she had been unamused that the other Witches had been having fun placing bets on something that was the greatest nightmare for most Witches, herself included. It was not meant in malice however and to taunt the others back, Sasha herself put in a bet of a thousand rubles, one year's salary for the average soldier, on herself losing her magic 'Never'.

She knew she would lose that bet, but it had been good fun to see people trip over themselves to enter the pool to try and win that 1000 rubles.

Six months past, the largest pool was that she would lose her magic 'This month' with her own one thousand rubles alone bet on that she would lose her magic 'Never'.

Now, she heard that the largest pool was stacked firmly in that she would lose her magic 'Never'.

Apparently it was a ritual for Witches, soldiers, and even their families to place a small bet into the pool that she would lose her magic 'Never' before heading for the front.

As if they could prevent the inevitable through prayer.

A ridiculous thought.

God did not exist. Otherwise there would be no Neuroi. Let alone these new Neuroi of the past six months.

If there was a God, then it was a sadistic being from whom humanity had no business asking for salvation.

Mulling in her thoughts, Sasha nearly missed it as Orel squadron dove down and flew fast and low along the railway, cutting down the pursuing Neuroi fliers behind the train.

Burning past the train, Sasha saw it was in a bad way.

Despite being built to military spec as an armoured troop transport, many of the compartments had been sliced by lasers, left open to the air. The rear and middle locomotives were scorched, but appeared to be still running. Four of the five gun carriages were silent, gun turrets burning as the train trucked forwards. Never the less, the chassis of the train was intact, even it couldn't run, Berkut had all gone through the large scale Witch manoeuvre drills required of all formations larger than a squadron, they could carry this entire train to Harbin if they really, really needed to.

Shooting down a medium type flier right in front of the lead locomotive, Sasha peered in as they blasted past. Nine Witches and several soldiers. Looks like another group had the same idea to get people out of the complex.

Ahead, the Butcher's Nest loomed, white concrete buildings sullied by smoke and soot, it was now the same colour as the other buildings in South Harbin. The various buildings leaned crazily and the land was cracked, sunken in places and jutting upwards in others. Even a full speed impact of the Neuroi transport couldn't tilt a concrete redoubt so that its very foundations would rise from the Earth, something else had caused this. Neuroi marched through the grounds, mostly unopposed, lasers lancing out at the few strong points that remained.

Raising her cannon and centring the sights on a Neuroi medium walker as they shot into the grounds proper, a wave of heat and a flash of white light stuck Orel One. As one, the flight ignored their previous targets and headed for the source. Any Hellfire armed unit was a serious issue that needed sorting out.

A burning, but intact ultra heavy walker sat inside the railway courtyard. If it was still there when the train arrived…

"Orel One! Shred then kill!"

'Shred then kill' when attacking large Neuroi close to where other human forces were, amputate as much mass as possible before taking the core shot to prevent collateral, implausible with gargantuan Large flyers, but workable on large walkers and oversized medium types. Silently agreeing to the plan, Sasha pulled slightly ahead, taking the vanguard position and firing at the walker's knees.

As she passed by one of the exposed tunnels however, she saw a something that made her blood freeze.

Emaciated. Missing limbs. Missing organs, eyes, ears. Tortured, tongue, teeth, nails, gone, pulled. Scar tissue, old and new, how long have they been here?

The sad victims of the Butcher's Nest huddled on the ground inside an exposed tunnel, struggling to draw breath and shelter from the heat. Only the fact that the air rushed past them, from within the facility, saved them from being cooked alive.

We can't destroy the walker here, they'll die, even with shred then kill tactics.

Making a snap decision, Sasha once again used her magic, "Orel One, I have Control."

"You have control." affirmed the five other Witches, voices eager.

Pushing magical reinforcement to its limit, empowering every single cell, every atom, within her body to the absolute maximum, Sasha included the other Witches inside her magic took a direct collision course. They slammed into the Ultra Heavy Walker, carrying far more energy than what conventional physics suggests their mass and velocity should allow, launching it into the air.

The Witches worked as a single organism, co-ordinating firepower and magic, reducing the walker to a mere shadow of itself in the single second of time it was airborne.

The core shattered and a group shield prevented any of the shards from striking the prisoners behind them. Orbiting once to clear the Neuroi medium walkers on the ground, Sasha stopped them and released Sokol flight One from her magic with a thought.

Yion turned to her, looking slightly dazed, "Wow, that's your magic? That was- Wait- never mind that. *Ahem*"

"Orel Two, make for my position, we have-" Yion yelped, throwing up a shield as 40mm cannon rounds smacked into her.

A Fusoan self propelled anti air gun skidded across the ground beneath them, the shells hadn't been an accident, the cannon was actively tracking the Witches.

Sasha cut her thrust, lowering her altitude, then magically enhanced her voice, "Friendlies! Hold fire we're-"

The cannon swung, spitting rounds at her instead.

What the hell, I'm barely fifty meters distant, there's no way they could false ID at this range.

Sasha snatched the first shell out of the air and threw it at a strafing small type, blowing it apart, letting the rest of the cannon rounds explode against her shield. Despite the shining blue shield, obviously from a human Witch, the SPAAG continued to fire, skidding across the bumpy ground, running over a set of Neuroi infantry bots. A laser from a surviving Neuroi walker impacted it from the edge of the grounds, causing it burst into flames and crash into an overturned tank.

Cutting down the walker in turn, Sasha searched for survivors on the burning SPAAG and found none. Confused, she jetted back towards Sokol flight One. Yion gave her a helpless shrug which Sasha returned. Neither had any idea what those Fusoan soldiers were thinking.

"Orel Two, make for my position, we have prisoners whom need protecting."

A thunderous bang rang out as metal gates were smashed aside, a train entering the courtyard, shovel shaped prow shoving aside displaced soil that lay on the rails.

XxXxXxXxXx

Sergeant Nasr Bilgrami heard the blast of the horn as he ran towards the mouth of the tunnel. The prisoners standing aside for the SAS men looked on with desperate hope. The train was here, but what stood between them and the train? Lieutenant Havildar had gone to the mouth of the tunnel, but he hadn't sent a runner back to the men at the other sides of the barricades.

The prisoners were shifting forwards, desperate to leave the underground tunnels where they had suffered their awful torture.

"Stay back till we give the all clear!"

Sergeant Bilgrami ran into a wall of heat as he progressed, it was so hot that the air felt like a punch to the lungs. On the ground the prisoners gasped, suffering from instant heat exhaustion. He could also see weak sunlight pouring in, far closer than where the breech had been before, what had happened?

The SAS Sergeant was still reeling from the heat when with a roar like a Raksha's own drums filled the corridor. A flight of Witches flew down from the sky into the corridor. Sergeant Bilgrami saw the short black hair of the lead Witch and instinctively raised his submachine gun, firing a burst at the Fusoan Witch.

The arm of the Witch blurred and a whip sharp crack ran through the air. She slammed her palm into wall with an impact that cracked the wall and Bilgrami could see the six lead bullets he had fired smashed flat against the concrete.

"Friendlies for the sake of God and Nation!" the Witch snapped in… Orussian? Maybe reinforcements? Bilgrami lowered the sights of the SMG but kept it shouldered, gesturing to the two men beside him to do the same, as little as the gun would help against a Strike Witch.

"Richard of York!" barked the Sergeant.

The Witches looked at each other in confusion as their turbojets spun down, "Is that Britannian?" "No its Gallian I think." "I don't speak Gallian." "I speak a bit of Gallian, that was not Gallian." "Does anyone actually know what he said?"

One of the Witches to the back raised her hands and cool air washed across Nasr's face as she used magic to relieve the unbearable heat.

Sergeant Bilgrami sighed as he lowered his gun, if these Witches were hostile he and the two SAS men with him wouldn't stand a snowflakes chance in front of Agni and if the lead Witch was who he thought she was, she could probably sweep the entire 28th SAS, the 106th IOG and the 15th SIS Corps all by herself.

Switching to Orussian he said, "That was Britannian. I'm Sergeant Bilgrami from the SAS. We need your help."

The lead Witch raised a hand and stepped forwards, "Wing Commander Vasilyev. We will escort the people here to the train. We will clear any Neuroi that attempt to interfere. We will escort this train clear of the Butcher's Nest once loading is complete. Anything else Sergeant?"

Nasr raised an eyebrow, he had been completely pre-empted, "No, that's more than I could have hoped for. Thank you."

The Witch tilted her head with a slight smile, "Thank me after we get clear. How many more prisoners remain inside?"

"A thousand at least- but Wing Commander, you cannot save them, there are Sorceresses inside." blurted Nasr.

The Witches froze. The Wing Commander strode forwards, her tone urgent, "Sorceresses? How many Sergeant? How many inside?"

"At least two dozen-"

"Orel Three, Four! Break! Break! Repeat! Break!" A brown haired Witch shouted into her earpiece.

A shortwave radio. They worked somewhat even under jamming but were short ranged, easy to block, barely working in something as thin as clouds. The thick concrete would block the radio dead.

"Sasha! I can't- Please…" the brown haired Witch spun to Wing Commander Vasilyev, face desperate.

"Stay here Yion, help them, I'll get the others."

Forming a backplate with a magic shield, the Wing Commander blasted into the sky.

Sergeant Bilgrami silently wished for her good luck as the prisoners finally began stepping into the sun, stumbling towards the train.

XxXxXxXxXx

Flight Lieutenant Sofia Domnin lead Orel flights three and four deeper and deeper in the complex, their Jet Strikers whirring as they ran on turbine power. She anxiously counted down the seconds in her head, the complex was labyrinthine and they did not have much time.

"Orel, sixty seconds."

It had been great news to hear that a large group of the prisoners had been near the surface, she wasn't sure they would be able to find any prisoners otherwise. They left a line in the wall to mark their route, Emilia, leader of fight Four sticking her finger into the wall and dragging it to make a distinct line of broken concrete.

"Orel, one hundred seconds."

They spiralled deeper and deeper into the complex. Scorched ceramic, blasted doors and dead bodies formed a trail, yet they encountered no one and nothing. The only noise was the whirl of their Striker units and the sound of breathing.

"Orel, one hundred and fifty seconds. The door ahead is the last one, if we find nothing, then we turn back."

Sofia Domnin would never reach that door. It opened by itself.

They found dozens of prisoners in terrible condition. They found Neuroi infantry walkers carrying those prisoners.

They found dozens of Sorceresses guarding those walkers.

XxXxXxXxXx

Sasha swung into the air, heading for the entrance that Orel flights Three and Four used. As she rose, line of sight to the plains was re-established and a radio message came in.

"*kssh* -erkut. Urgent. Transports are setting down. We have casualties, one flight. Sorcs in pursuit. Need support. Berkut do you copy?" Sasha swung her head around, Jastreb flight were approaching the facility, trading fire with the Sorceresses pursuing them.

Behind them, rivers of Neuroi were pouring down from the transports as they finally set down and spreading to encircle the facility. There was absolutely no way the train would make it through on the rails. It would have to be carried.

"Jastreb, advise that Sorcs present at Butcher's Nest. More than twenty, that is more than two zero. Orel is unable to provide support."

For a moment Sasha hesitated, voice choking in indecision. She could order Sokol to move in from the North to support Orel and Jastreb but that would have many of the Witches of Berkut Wing no doubt fall, possibly to no end if there remained not enough Witches to carry the train out. She could order Jastreb to head South and link with Sokol and then drag Orel out as well, abandoning the prisoners they were here to rescue to certain death.

If Berkut Wing fell here, or were even just rendered combat ineffective for a few months, many thousands of Orussian soldiers and dozens of Orussian Witches would no doubt die, missing their presence on the field. Utilitarianism, taught to every officer no matter the service or nationality, dictated that the prisoners below simply had less value than a Wing of Witches such as the Berkut, more lives would be saved if they abandoned those below.

But…

Indecision wracked her.

"Jastreb! Sokol are on the way along with the local garrison, swing North!"

"Copy Sokol."

Alexis made the decision for her. Sasha felt a wash of shame as she dove into the tunnels. Neither Alexis nor Yion would willingly abandon the prisoners, Sasha knew that, she knew that if she did not respond, to call for them to withdraw, that they would place their lives on the line. Now they might all die through Sasha's indecision.

Negative thoughts had a time and a place however and Sasha dismissed her pessimistic thoughts as she raced down the tunnels. The turns were tight and the tunnels narrow, but Sasha didn't slow, forming shields along the walls to turn herself, following the divot dug into the walls.

She didn't have to fly long.

The intersection ahead of Sasha exploded.

Carrying the bleeding and unconscious form of Sofia, Fourth flight leader Emilia turned around the corner. Right behind her, two other Witches of Sokol 3rd flight supported each other, trailing fire from spluttering strikers, both missing their right arms. The last member of 3rd flight, Maya Bogrov, was nowhere to be seen. The three other members of flight Four seemed in better shape, flying and firing back down the corridor.

However, even as she watched, a laser slipped past their shields, right up the exhaust channel of Valentina Zaytsev. The Strike unit immediately detonated, blowing her leg off from the knee, she spun towards the wall, a spiral of blood painting the corridor behind her.

Sasha felt a shout of dismay rip itself from her throat. She barely caught the tumbling girl with one shield as she severed the flaming turbojet from the remaining Strike unit with a separate shield, cutting off the girl's foot but saving her calf as it also exploded.

Blasting past the retreating Witches, Sasha pulled a snap turn and caught Valentina, shoving her into the hands of Kristina and Anna. They looked at her wide eyed, "Berk-"

"Fly!"

Without a word, the injured Witches turned and burned, pulling through the corridors. Sasha snapped a shield across the entire corridor, stemming the lasers that flew forth from the Sorceresses. One fired a laser through a side corridor and a laser smashed into a reflex shield Sasha projected behind her back. Had it really bent a laser through the hundreds of meters of corridor to an intersection, then back to strike at her from a direction not covered by her shield? Immediately the other Sorceresses followed, firing lasers in all vectors with one lance as they charged hellfire blasts with their other.

Sasha scowled and pulsed an omnidirectional shield, pushing at the surrounding corridors, lifting the ceiling for dozens of meters. The Neuroi Witches realised almost immediately what she planned and flew backwards. Still too late however, as Sasha let go of the materials and walls she was holding up, collapsing the corridor and those of the intersection for dozens of meters.

XxXxXxXxXx

Yion and Orel flight One were buzzing at the entrance of the facility when Flights Three and Four blasted out. The injured Witches setting down on the ground as the command from Sasha's magic disappeared now they were outside the facility. They had barely escorted the injured Witches to the train when a huge plume of dust exploded from the entrance of the Butcher's Nest, a small sinkhole forming in the ground as some part of the underground facility collapsed.

Yion felt her heart catch in her throat for a few moments, then with an explosion of earth and a flare of magic, Sasha erupted from the ground.

The two dozen Sorceresses that followed, erupting from the ground like blood soaked scarabs, blasting lasers and plasma bursts up at the Wing Commander, were not so nearly a welcome a sight.

"Orel! Engage at distance!"

From the North the other group of sixteen Sorceresses banked and closed hard, intent on joining in on the developing dogfight above the Butcher's Nest, dragging Sokol, Jastreb and an additional twenty local Witches towards the facility with them.

XxXxXxXxXx

Shots rang out and yet another pair of Neuroi infantry bots collapsed in front of Janissary as she cleared the route to the surface.

The remains of the Third squad had not met any Fusoan kill teams for a good while, but isolated groups of Neuroi infantry, generally in pairs and trios were becoming more and more common. Janissary quickly swapped magazines, cursing at her choice of ammunition. With how little magic she could use, the hollow point 9mm from the Walther PPK, specialised for taking down humans, struggled to break the armour of the Neuroi infantry, every shot had to precisely placed.

Far worse was that the infantry now had shields, capable of resisting a single magic enhanced bullet. She only had twenty five bullets left in total, then it was down to hand to hand. Hopefully it would not come to that.

They were very nearly at the tunnels where the exit was to be blown. Janissary took and look back and signalled the sole SAS trooper of the vanguard, the other three following from the rear. He held up a hand and signalled for the train of prisoners to slow as Janissary took a deep breath.
Engaging shadow tracking, she darted around the corner. Far closer than she anticipated, sunlights poured in from the ceiling, the corridor neatly cut through along with the ground around it.

Ahead of her, a flight of Witches hovered. For a moment, Janissary almost opened fire from the concealment of the shadows, feeling a rush of ice at the thought of fighting Striker unit equipped Witches, but then checked herself. They were not the same as the Fusoan child psychopaths within the facility, whom only ever looked gleeful or enraged, moving with the synchronised precision that spoke of a lifetime of indoctrination. These withes were older, looking to the skies, worried, biting their lips, hands raised in preparations to project shields. Uncertain and green, almost certainly their first or second battle.

Calm enough to look past them, Janissary could see more of these Witches escorting prisoners to the armoured train that rested on the rails.

Approaching, Janissary shouted "Ni shi bu shi Zhong Guo ren?"

The Witches spun, startled at the sight of the suit clad woman suddenly appearing beneath them, "Ni she shui?!"

They responded in Zhongwen, good.

Janissary continued in Zhongwen, "I'm Britannian SIS! We've got a train of prisoners!"

The lead Witch bobbed in the air then shouted, "More? Hurry it up! We will get them to the train! I don't know how long they can hold the Sorceresses back!"

Janissary looked up as she turned back towards the tunnel and gasped. Blue exhaust trails, red lasers, yellow tracers and blinding white plasma crisscrossed the sky. A full throttle Wing on Wing engagement was occurring right over their heads, above the Butcher's Nest. She counted over forty Witches flying against a near equal number of Sorceresses as she re-entered the tunnel.

She frantically waved at the single vanguard, conveying urgency with the energy of her actions and the train of prisoners quickly moved up as he hurried them along.

Consensus throughout Allied command, informed by grim faced Witch Flight Lieutenants and Wing Commanders, was that these Neuroi units, these Sorceresses, suffered a third to a fifth the attrition rate of Witches upon engagements. Against rookie Witches, this could skew as far as one tenth to one twentieth. Even against famous, supposedly invincible Witch formations such as the Witches of the various squadrons of the Allied 500th Wing Joint Flying Witches, the Liberion Flying Tigers and the Orussian Golden Eagles, Sorceresses still managed to down three Witches for every two of their own.

Added to the Neuroi's peculiar traits of growing in deadliness as their numbers within an area swelled, the situation above the Butcher's Nest would almost certainly deteriorate fast.

The prisoners streamed out of the tunnel, across the square to the train, covered by the hovering Zhongwen Witches, whom were almost all looking up, occasionally taking pot shots at the dogfight above.

The situation was rapidly worsening in the sky as Janissary feared, watching from the mouth of the tunnel. Fiery explosions bloomed as every Sorceress in sky abruptly turned and fired at one flight of Witches in perfect synchronisation, downing two instantly, the flaming bodies of the girls falling from the skies as their strikers exploded. The other two of the flight dove, trailing smoke and blood as they made for an emergency crash landing. One took a hellfire strike to the back, the bolt cutting through her flickering shield, then through the Witch, bisecting her. Another flight of Witches interposed themselves as another hellfire strike lanced downwards, saving the remaining Witch whom slammed into the ground, barely managing to mitigate her crash with a shield. Several local Witches quickly flew forwards, picking up the blood covered girl and carrying her over to the train.

Distant screams from within the tunnel interrupted her. Janissary snapped her gaze down.

The prisoners exiting from the tunnel were beginning to push and shove, looking back over their shoulders as they started stampeding. Desperate relatives, shielding weaker relations, lashed out at those whom pressed in around them. Already weakened humans with no one to shield them were pushed aside, pushed against the walls and squashed, pushed to the ground and trampled.

Jumping down and plucking a skinny girl without eyes from within the mob, Janissary jumped back up, setting her down, handing her over to a man whom had kept his head and was supporting another two children. He gave her a short thanks and hurried towards the train.

Two Zhongwen Witches buzzed to a stop above the riot, shouting in magic enhanced voices, demanding to the crowd to calm down and tell them what was going on.

Only a few people paid heed, turned their heads upwards, "Hei Yaomo zai limien! Hei Yaomo!"

Neuroi inside! Neuroi!

The Witches immediately buzzed forwards then stopped, hesitating. They were not veterans, trying to fly in the narrow space between the ceiling and the heads of the people that ran below without hurting them with their downdraft was too great an ask.

"I'll go in first!" shouted Janissary up to them, they threw her a quick thumbs up showing they understood and Janissary sprinted in, footsteps light as she ran on the shoulders of the people below, small bursts of magic supporting most of her weight.

The people rapidly thinned as she went deeper, past one turn, then two, only the singular, painfully staggering prisoner remaining in the hallways. Where were the Neuroi the people had been running from?

Janissary turned one last corner and got her answer.

The bodies of Private Rahmen and Ferdous sprawled on the ground. Precise holes drilled into the throats.

Eleven girls huddled in the corner.

A Neuroi Sorceress stood over them.

A chill raced over every surface of Janissary's body as she raised her pistol.

'Bad. This is bad.'

The sights aligned over the torso of Sorceress, directly over where the core was in an normal infantry walker.

'Not enough power. Shield won't break.'

Magic flooded her arms, flooding into the gun.

'Element of surprise. Use everything.'

She fired, magic infusing into the bullets and the pistol, bypassing the mechanical limitations of the weapon. Eight bullets fired out within a tenth of a second.

A shield formed.

One after another, the bullets smashed onto the exact same point of the shield, one on top of another.

The Sorceress turned, shield perfectly intact, snapping up an arm. Janissary discarded the empty magazine on her pistol.

'Dodge.'

Janissary dodged into the shadows and the laser missed.

'Close distance. Get inside its range.'

Jumping behind the Neuroi Sorceress, having reloaded the pistol, Janissary pressed the pistol into the Sorceresses- front?

Having completed a spin that would well put any figure skater to shame, the Sorceress brought her laser cannon to bear on Janissary's face. A red glow.

Leaning forwards past the laser projector, Janissary grabbed the arm and tried to elbow lock then throw the Sorceress. However, Neuroi were not articulated like humans. The Sorceress simply windmilled the arm, throwing Janissary right into the ceiling. The wind knocked out of her with a gasp, Janissary fell as the Neuroi pointed its arms at her falling body, white glow of hellfire building.

The demolition charge attached to the arm of the Neuroi detonated, wrecking both weapon projectors and cracking the armour of its torso as the shaped charge exploded. White lightning sizzled from destroyed capacitors as the Sorceress staggered in the air.

Janissary landed on her feet and charge forwards, bringing the pistol to bear. Before she could squeeze the trigger, the Sorceress pointed its arm at her and lightning blasted out, striking Janissary on her right arm. The electricity blast completely burnt through her blazer, scorching the thin runic plates she wore under it. Some electricity also crackled over the Sorceress, but did no visible damage.

Losing control of her body, Janissary fell to the floor as electricity unmitigated by the runic plates ran through her body. The purple glow of repairing Neuroi filled the corridor, concentrated on its left arm as the Sorceress once again pointed the newly repaired laser projector at her.

Before it fired though, the Sorceress turned and seemed to vibrate in mid-air, shifting left and right, dodging incoming machine gun fire, shields only occasionally flaring to block shots. A pair of Zhongwen Witches, the two whom had swooped down to check the riot at the tunnel exit, tracked the Sorceress with their Type 92s.

Janissary coughed weakly on the floor, limbs still twitching.

A white glow built up as the Sorceress charged a hellfire shot. Both Witches concentrated fire on the left arm. Bullets finally connected, breaking through the shield and tearing away at the plasma projector, destroying it before it had a chance to fire. Lasers lanced out, the Sorceress taking opportunity to repair its right weapon projector behind its back as the two Witches concentrated on the left. Surprised, both Witches still managed to get shields up. However, the lasers were fired to the side of the Witches, curving around their shields and striking both girls directly.

Janissary grabbed at her pistol, but her fingers were numb, clumsy, even magical reinforcement did little to help.

One Witch collapsed, a laser lancing right into her heart, her strikers tearing into the ground as they spun down, sending her body limply tumbling. The other listed in in pain, sides burnt so severely that the shape of the ribcage was visible, steam rising from her flanks as her organs cooked. She screamed, pain and rage combined, holding down her trigger at the Sorceress. The Neuroi dodged the rounds deftly, red glow of lasers building.

Janissary finally regained control of her body. She grabbed, primed, and threw another demolition charge in a single movement.

Another roar filled the corridor as the demolition charge detonated next to the Sorceress. A moment later, the ceiling of the abused corridor collapsed with a rumbling crash. Janissary rolled on the ground, just barely managing to stay ahead of the falling concrete and soil.

Coughing, she stood up. Dust filled the corridor and the lights flickered out, finally giving up completely, plunging the corridor into darkness.

Confused and scared voices echoed out around Janissary and she flickered on her electric torch. The other girls were huddled in two groups, uninjured as far as Janissary could see, dust covering their clothing.

Turning the torch to the pile of rubble blocking the hallway, Janissary tried to see if there was a way around the obstrcut-

The rubble shifted. Red light shining from the cracks.

"Run!" shouted Janissary at the girls. They bolted.

A red and violet glow filled the corridor as the Neuroi Sorceress rose, shrugging off the debris. It lifted a laser projector.

Janissary entered the shadows, escaping.

XxXxXxXxXx

Back in the corridor, the Neuroi collapsed into a pile, parts of its body detaching as the quickly made facsimile disintegrated, red lights rapidly fading.

XxXxXxXxXx

Sasha twisted her body to the side, dodging a pair of lasers and keeping a Sorceress in her sights at the same time. Her HS.404 kicked and five 20mm shells streaked towards the Sorceress. It dodged the way only the Neuroi could, abruptly decelerating without any change in stance, but Sasha guided the rounds in with magic, slamming them into the Sorceress. The cannon rounds broke through the shields and slammed into the Neuroi, detonating and blowing apart the Sorceress.

The comms were filled with reports as Berkut Wing and the Neuroi Sorceresses did their very best to murder each other.

"Jastreb Three, Sorcs behind high."
"Jastreb Lead, Jastreb Three is at half ammo."
"Orel Lead, Orel Two is joining in from your four, low."
"Sokol Three, sorcs, above fast."
"Berkut, sorcs, seven behind."
​
Warned, Sasha pulled up, and a burst of plasma shot under her. Completing her Immelmann turn, Sasha lifted her auto-cannon and pumped rounds at the flight of Sorceresses ahead.

Lasers hissed out, precisely slicing her incoming rounds to pieces.

Suddenly, every Neuroi Sorceress in the battle turned and fired their lasers at her. Lasers turned and twisted through the air, arrived from all vectors, striking her all over, searching for holes in her omnidirectional shield. Sasha smirked slightly at that, she could form shields so durable they could take a charged heavy laser from a Neuroi large flyer. Comparatively, even the lasers of every Sorceress here combined were but a fraction of the power a single large flyer could project.

"Jastreb Lead, Jastreb Two is half ammo"
"This is Sokol Four Lead, two casualties, carrying them down."
​
Far more cheering to her was that if they were shooting at her, they weren't shooting at the rest of Berkut, almost all of whom had a better magic speciality combat wise. Even as she watched the rest of the battle from the corner of her eye, Yion caught two of the Neuroi within one of her Gravity Wells, crushing them and Alexis fired a column of her own hellfire at a Sorceress, the pyrokinetic giving the Neuroi a taste of it's own medicine. They had been able use their more powerful magic thanks to the Neuroi turning to fire upon Sasha.

"This is Orel Lead, scratch two."
"This is Sokol Three Lead, taking off."
"Sokol Three, Orel Four needs assistance, they're to your eleven, five hundred distant"
​
Ahead, the flight of Sorceresses approached more charged lasers filling the sky towards her. Auto-cannon rounds from Sasha responded to their lasers as their distances closed, practically running head on into each other.

"This is Sokol Two, our magic's in the red, landing"
"Jastreb Two Lead, Two Four ammo out"
​
If the Neuroi wanted a collision, Sasha was perfectly fine with that. Injecting magic directly into the turbojets, Sasha activated the afterburner function of the RD-20 engine, deliberately igniting her left striker late to make an abrupt turn. The Sorceress had barely started to peel away when Sasha rammed it, their relative speeds meaning that she smashed into it at over four times the speed of sound. The impact of the Witch crushed the shield of the Sorceress instantly and crumpled its body, smashing one arm, raised to guard, right in half.

"My shield's gone! Natalia, I-"
"Orel Four Two is hit! Four Three, catch her!"
"Orel Four Three, break! Sokol Three Lead, Sorc right above!"
​
Sasha fired another three cannon rounds into the Sorceress for surety and turned, looking right into a pair of Sorceresses as they fired their plasma casters at her. So this is what they had planned when they charged right at her to close the distance.

"Jastreb Four Two, you've got smoke, left Striker."
"Sokol Lead, you've got five Sorcs on you, break right!"
​
Forming a five layered shield over her hand, Sasha caught all four hellfire blasts and flung them back at the Sorceresses. It didn't connect, the plasma exploding violently halfway there, but the explosion buffered the Sorceresses, allowing Sasha to destroy one with a single cannon round to the chest and blast the other in half, the 20mm deflected slightly by an angled shield, impacting its waist instead of chest, missing the core.

A Neuroi Sorceress rammed her from the side, throwing off her aim as she made to finish off the bisected Sorceress. A glimmer of red caught her eye, had the Sorceress just ejected her own core? Sasha raised an eyebrow at the unusual tactic and formed a box of shields around the Sorceress in case she saw wrong and compressed it, crushing the Sorceress inside.

"Jastreb Lead, Orel Lead, Sokol Lead needs assistance!"
"Unable. Engaged."
"On my way."
​
Neuroi dust exploded from the facsimile, the booby trap body specially created for this purpose, the grains far finer and denser than usual, filtering through her shields. Sasha hissed in alarm, drawing down her Striker units and forming a more discriminate shield over the air intakes, but it was too late as the dust sucked right into her turbojets, both Striker units shrieked, choked, then detonated. Sasha barely had enough time to form a shield to prevent the explosion damaging the magic dynamos.

"What the?! No way! Berkut-!"
"I'm still here, engines are out." Sasha hastily interjected. From a distance, it would look like she had been shot down when she only had her ankles slightly scorched.
​
Still, she was falling. Slicing off the now useless air intakes with shields, Sasha breathed in, closing her eyes briefly. Magic bloomed around her, seizing the air itself, holding her aloft. She couldn't fly completely without Strike Units, but she could fly with just the magic dynamos increasing her magic output.
Glaring upwards at the Sorceresses orbiting in for another attack run Sasha lifted her autocannon and rose. They suddenly pulled back, withdrawing. For a moment, a ragged cheer arose over the radio, then eyes followed to where the Sorceresses were retreating to.

"Berkut. Heavy Incoming. All types. All vectors." Nina actually sounding slightly panicked.
​
Sasha really didn't need to be told. Every one of the thirty two members of Berkut still flying could see just fine.

Whereas there had been rivers of Neuroi pouring down from the transports, now that they had all disembarked, there was a literal ocean of black surrounding the Butcher's Nest, seeming to stretch all the way to the horizon. Their escorts, no longer lingering over the transports closed in from all sides.

Literally one million Neuroi infantry, one and a half thousand medium walkers, fifteen ultra heavy walkers, forty of some form of large walker, at least half a thousand small fliers, one hundred medium fliers and ten more large fliers. Added to the Sorceresses, which despite all their best efforts had remained at equal numbers with the Strike Witches, it would be an absolute massacre.

The infantry were beginning to dig, the million strong army moving like a tremendous drill, digging into the ground of the hill around the Butcher's Nest.

"Berkut Wing! Loading of train is complete! Come back Berkut!" One of the Britannian Witches on the train.

Come back and do what?

There's no way we can carry the train through that. We'll be shot down, then the train will fall and they will die. If green Witches like the locals with you try to fight their way through, they will die also.

We've done all we can.

I have to save my girls.

"Berkut. Pick up our injured. We're leaving the rest behind."

XxXxXxXxXx

"Wait, where are we going?"

They small group of cut off survivors stopped, various members panting in fear and exertion. The floor was tilted, cracks ran through the walls and ceiling and the only source of light was Janissary's electric torch. Janissary turned around, looking over the group of survivors, pointing the torch at the ceiling to avoid flash blinding anyone and still provide adequate illumination.

Eleven girls, all off whom were giving off the slight thrum of magic, or residual magic at the least. Janissary was never a good sensor, that was all Leona.

The Zhongwen girls were on their knees, gasping. Janissary sympathised, but now that the situation forced to use her last option as the avenue of escape, time was far more crucial than before.

"Stand. I'll explain as we walk. Speed is of the essence."

The girls hauled themselves to their feet, the grim look of determination on their faces. Janissary blinked at that, these girls had been hardened by their time here rather than being broken, she wasn't sure if that was a good thing however.

"We are heading to an underground dock. One that is always unguarded and secret to everybody here except two. There's a submarine down there that probably leads to Songyuang through the underground river. We, the Britannians are keeping an eye on a possible dock for this submarine, if we use it, I can contact other members of the SIS and make sure they never get their hands on you again."

"I… thank you so-"

"Don’t thanks me yet, stay on guard."

Janissary lead the way, sweeping her pistol back and forth, the path to the underground docks was deliberately incredibly convoluted, but when you have a demolition charge remaining, certain shortcuts could be taken.

Just one hundred meters ahead around a turn, two hallways nearly crossed, the lower wall at the floor of their hallway nearly intersecting with the upper wall of a descending hallway, leaving a wall section a meter in height and several dozen long where the partition was only a dozen centimeters thick.

Far above their heads, a laser missed Galina Dementyev as she spun, lancing down to strike one of the outriding buildings of the Butcher's nest. The ammunitions storage inside the basement, exposed by the upper floors collapsing, detonated with a terrific explosion, barely noticed in the aerial battle.

For the survivors underground, the effect was far more dramatic. The corridor actually leapt sideways, sending everyone inside stumbling.

Cracks radiated across the ceiling. Concrete cracked.

No one needed any words, they all ran for it.

Janissary looked back, calculating their position and the position where the cracks on the walls terminated, they wouldn't all make it. Two of the girls would be crushed.

Then the blond haired girl slowed, shoving the Fusoan prisoner forwards, just clear of the falling ceiling. At the last moment, Janissary recognised her. Gaunt, thinner, haggard, but it was Katyusha Zharkov.

The the girl she just pushed clear must have been...

Concrete crashed onto her split moments later.
Janissary ran back, but even from a glance, she could tell the girl was beyond saving. The blond girl looked up at her, eyes surprisingly calm and lucid. She pointed at the Fusoan girl and clearly said, "Her name is Kunato Minori. She saved my life."

I know.

She coughed, red splattered onto the ground, "She saved my life, but… but I couldn't save hers. Please…"

I was there.

"Take care of her… please, give her life… back." the girl whispered, her head bowing and resting on the floor as her strength left her.

I didn't help you then. I could have.

Janissary leaned down and grabbed her hand, "I will. I promise. Even if it's the last thing I do."

The corridor rumbled again, Janissary grabbed Minori and sprinted away, dragging her along.

"Ah-aaaah. Kah-Kat- Katyusha…" moaned Minori, the other girl reaching back, eyes sharpening in recognition for a brief moment.

In her last moments Katyusha Zharkov smiled, maybe she had managed to repay her life debt after all.
The rest of the hallway collapsed.

XxXxXxXxXx

Harbin southern Perimeter headquarters was in chaos. When Colonel Zheng has gone up in smoke, so had most of the other officers who were actually in charge of the Harbin Perimeter. Southern Perimeter was supposed to fall under the command of South Harbin logistic base, but General Zhu had headed north towards the city proper with the garrison from the base, leaving no senior officers on call.

Not that would have helped, the local lines were completely jammed, the supposed separation of military and civilian ground lines proving themselves never to have been implemented.

So when the reports came in that a huge army of ground type Neuroi were massing, most of them north of the Butcher's Den to the south of Harbin, perfectly positioned to cut off evacuation convoys, what to do landed on the shoulders of fifty eight year old Major Shen Wu Pun.

His answer was immediate.

"Redirect all our artillery. Fire upon their mustering zone."

Captain Hui Wang Qin immediately objected, "Sir! The M115s are inaccurate, shells will land in the Southern suburbs and there's got to be at least thirty thousand people within that area! We-"

"Captain they are already as good as dead. The Neuroi are landing practically on top of them. Our priority is preventing them from encircling the city. There are one hundred and fifty thousand people in Harbin proper, and the Neuroi infantry will actively try to break into shelters." Major Shen said.

"The Neuroi may choose not to fire upon those around them, I've heard from my friend in the signal corps that they offered a surrender over at Romagna!" replied Captain Hui, obstinate.

"Captain, I don't want to hear rumours from halfway around the planet. Have you ever. Ever. Seen the Neuroi spare humans?" snapped Major Shen, distantly remembered pain entering his voice.

"I… there is hope-"

"Captain. Have you ever seen a Neuroi spare a human with your own eyes? A soldier with all his limbs severed trying to safe his wife? A pleading woman trying to shield her child? A begging boy, not even seven years of age, trying to save his grandfather?" Major Shen's voice cracked on the last sentence.

Captain Hui was silent, face ashen.

"I… have not Captain. I have never seen Neuroi spare a human. Not one." whispered Major Shen in the silence of the command center.

"We can't let them encircle the city. We can't let them die like the people of Mudang Jiang Chenshi did." continued the Major.

Captain Hui turned back to his station, speaking softly into the phone for a moment.

He faced the Major, face twitching, opened his mouth, closed it and swallowed, before trying again, "G-guns ready sir."

Major Shen took a deep breath, clutching at the stump of his left elbow, "Fire."

M115s, out of range to fire upon the northern group of Neuroi, turned, depressing their barrels, their gunnery crews not told of where their shells would land and being green, unable to ballpark the distance of their shells with experience.

Chain lightning that once again rolled through the Manchurian plain.

XxXxXxXxXx

"…What was that Berkut? You radio was malfunctioning."

"Repeat. Berkut Wing, descend to pick up our injur-"

"I know what you said! I want you to know that you're making a mistake!"

"Yion, we can't achieve anything by staying, there's too many Neuroi. We will never be able to carry the train out."

"Damn it Sasha! Alexis is- Alexis is already… we can't just…"

"Berkut Wing, I order-"

"SASHA DON'T YOU DARE!"

"-you all to-"

"Incoming. Heavy artillery barrage. Neuroi large types changing to defensive mode. Sorceresses peeling off to intercept."

"Berkut, belay last. Avalon Ancient Magic formation. While we still have the time, go!"

XxXxXxXxXx

"Here, the wall should be thin enough…"

Setting down her last demolition charge, Janissary ran back to a clear distance and blew it. A sharp bang rang out and the dividing wall was destroyed, exposing a hallway that ran downwards, lit by dim yellow gas bulbs.

Leaping down, she helped the prisoners down. Minori had already lost the brief moment of lucidity she displayed back in the hallway, humming slightly as she hopped down.

Janissary shook her head slightly as the group jogged down the corridor. So this mentally damaged girl was Kunato Minori. She hadn't recognised the girl at all. Brain damage of that scale, from the reports, she guessed that Minori herself would have been able to repair such damage, but as she was the victim, she wasn't sure Britannia's finest med Witches, for all that counted for now, would be able to cure her condition.

Several of the prisoners shivered as they continued descending, the air grew colder and colder, their breathes puffing mist.

It was almost three hundred meters under the surface when, bright white light shone from around a corner.

They had reached the third and last of the underground docks.

"Wait here," whispered Janissary as they came to the last corner before the dock.

The lights overhead hummed, connected to an independent power supply. Faint rumbling echoed from behind as something else in facility above collapsed. Otherwise, the underground chamber was completely silent. The water was flat, nearly mirror like. Even the air was cold and dead, just like when she first scouted this underground chamber.

The breathing of the prisoners behind her sounded far too loud in the stillness.

The smaller dock was a much simpler affair than the huge berths that held the I-400s. A simple dock extended out to the submarine. It wasn't even a true submarine, essentially an amphibious rail car that followed a set of guide wires. Simple to operate with basically one thrown lever, it was probably to be the rabbit vehicle for the top level men in this organisation.

Janissary entered the underground dock, sweeping over the smooth rocks, looking for any sign that someone else had been here.

There were none.

Slowly, she moved to the submarine itself, her shoes clicking on the blocky metal hull. The hatch hung open, the single operating lever unthrown.

Moving with a surge of speed, she flung herself at the hatch, catching onto the steel with a hollow gong that echoed through the chamber. She hung there at the hatch with one hand as her other swept the pistol over the interior.

No one. Still empty of people. Simple metal famed chairs were bolted into the walls and several cases rested in a corner, recently moved in. Probably more backup files moved here for the evacuation.

"Waaah?"

Janissary let go, dropping as she spun, nearly pressing the trigger as she completed her turn. Behind her, Minori stood on the hull, looking curious. How was she so quiet?

Growling an expletive under her breath, Janissary grabbed the girl and shoved her into the Submarine, "Waah!"

Climbing out, she padded to the tunnel entrance, where the other girls still huddled, looking around the corner.

She waved at them, signalling them to come forward.

Their eyes widened. Looking past her.

For the first and last time in her life, Janissary Bond wasn't fast enough.

Gunshots rang out.

Janissary collapsed as bullets cut into her spine and lungs, the right side of her body going numb.

Those echoes when she had dove into the cabin, weren't.

She collapsed into the ground, the shock dislodging the magazine of the pistol.

A Fusoan soldier walked around a corner of the pier, emerging from some tunnel with its entrance blocked from view by the rocks, submachine gun tracking towards the rescued Witches.

A gunshot rang out and the man toppled back, dropping his weapon, sliding off the smooth rocks and into the shallow water at the edge of the pier. The slide for Janissary's pistol locked forwards, the last bullet in the chamber spent to kill that man.

Janissary laboriously reached for the magazine just slightly out of reach.

Around that corner another man appeared.

The Director of 'Harbin City Hospital'.

He flickered his eyes between the sight of Agent 007 slowly reloading her pistol with one hand and the submachine gun mere meters in front of him. There was no way she would reload before he managed to pick up and aim the submachine gun.

He darted forwards, reaching the gun his subordinate dropped.

Just as he turned, raising the gun, a rock smashed into his shoulder, spinning him. The rescued Witches boiled out from the tunnel, teeth bared in a rictus of hate. He recovered from the first thrown rock in time to look up into the face of retribution as the Witches proceeded slam him bodily into the water, sitting upon his struggling body, forcing his head under the surface of the water. Fists and rocks descended on the conductor of all their woes. The struggling quickly weakened as one limb was torn off in a spray of blood, quickly followed by another.

Soon, the splashing of water was replaced with the squish of flesh and crunch of bone.

Their murderous revenge was interrupted by two rapid gunshots however. A Neuroi infantry bot toppled, bursting into dust inside the tunnel their little group had entered from.

"*cough* Hurry! Into the sub! The Neuroi are coming," Janissary shouted as she turned her body as much as she was able, bracing her arm on her numb shoulder.

The girls looked at the dust wide eyed as they awoke from their berserk rage. Eight ran for the sub, one running towards Janissary.

More gunshots ran out. The charitable girl stumbled back with a shriek as another two Neuroi infantry exploded into dust, collapsing out from the tunnel.

"No! Leave me! Go into the sub, pull the lever- *cough* next to the hatch! Lever next to the hatch! Go!"

The last Zhongwen prisoner dithered for split second, looking torn, then ran for the submarine as another Neuroi infantry bot turned the corner stumbling as bullets struck it.

XxXxXxXxXx

With a hiss of pneumatic gas, the hatch on top of the submarine closed and it slipped into the dark waters, descending to safety.

Janissary Bond smiled, the prisoners were safe.

Her blood spread slowly over the floor, reaching the stained waters as the numbness was spread up her body.

Slowly, her vision was losing colour. Still, she found movement easily enough, swinging her pistol across her body and tapping the trigger twice at an inquisitive Neuroi infantry bot. Only one bullet flew forth.

The infantry bot ducked around a corner as a flash of red shielding announced the bullet was deflected.

The slide locked forwards. All out. She tossed the Walther PPK away in disgust. It weakly clattered to a halt on the empty dock.

Her strength was leaving her, she knew she would die if left alone, but with the Neuroi so close… she knew too much…

Janissary drew a single shot derringer.

Her last gun.

One bullet. One purpose.

"Dulche et decorum est… pro patria mori…"

Bang

XxXxXxXxXx

With a crash, the train settled down in Northern Harbin. A huge, ragged cheer echoed from within as the former prisoners spilled forth, hugging each other, kissing the ground, delirious with happiness now they were free.

Sasha ignored the ones that ran up to her, babbling what she guessed were thanks, walking right past them, leaping over them when needed.

Alexis Shubin lay flat on the roof of the train. One arm was missing, both legs down from the knees, a laser burn that scorched half her scalp, practically all of her upper chest was charred by a hellfire strike. The Neuroi had killed her with her own magic, catching one of her blasts with a group shield and throwing it back. Sasha knew exactly where they had gotten that idea.

Next to her lay eight others of Berkut Wing.

The thirteen surviving Witches of Sokol squadron were gathered there, crying their hearts out. Nina Kulagina hugged the body of Iskra Gusin, normally expressionless face twisted in pain, tears cutting tracks through the smoke and grime on her face.

Berkut Wing stood in a circle around the bodies, many spaces gaping in their circle that their fellow Witches should have filled. Disbelief and shock on their faces as the extent of their losses sunk in.

Thirty two Witches remained combat capable, all with some form of injuries. Eleven injured, various degrees.

Nine dead.

Around them, streams of people moved past, the populace of Northern Harbin exiting their shelters, carrying whatever they could hold, moving to the north west. Daqing was going to host another refugee camp before too long. The bridges were again crowded as those who fled south initially now ran back north. Away from the huge sea of black towards the south. Sasha could hear the faint sounds of looting starting in the distance, the army utterly devastated by the Neuroi attack unable to provide any form of security. Fires still raged through the city, Sasha idly wondered why they had not been put out before remembering that not even half an hour had passed since Berkut first engaged the Neuroi, of course fires of that scale would take time to extinguish.

A rumble overhead announced the arrival of another Wing of jet striker equipped Witches.

Sasha recognised the extravagant paint easily enough. Liberion 1st Air Assault Group, 1st Wing, the Flying Tigers.

They hovered over Northern Harbin, seeming to deliberating what to do before breaking into squadrons. One of the Liberion Witches however, headed right down for Sasha, disengaging her jet strikers.

"Sasha."

"Claire. Hello."

Wing Commander Claire Lee Chennault shook her head slightly, looking over Berkut Wing, their injured, their dead. She seemed lost for words.

Finally, she simple spread her arms. Sasha leaned forwards into the hug, utterly exhausted.

"I'm sorry we weren't here."

XxXxXxXxXx

"A great disaster? No, we could not have hoped for a greater success. The Neuroi went out of their way to attack the Children of Heaven. We have finally discovered something even they fear. Accelerate the research, everything is now available to you. Kannagara will be our salvation!"

XxXxXxXxXx

"Huaah…" mummered Minori, looking at the various lights of the status indicators in the cockpit of the submarine.

The creak of metal bending, then snapping.

Minori turned around inquisitively.

Two of the former prisoners walked towards her, holding bars of metal, broken from the frames of the chairs.

Hate glimmered in their eyes.

XxXxXxXxXx

And then there were None.

###Author's note

Um, nothing much to say, except I actually came up with Janissary's Shadow Tracking before the Ghost Queens appeared, yes I've been writing this since Turn 8 >_>, it's from a manga called Battle Angle Alita, but now she looks like a budget Ghost Queen. Whoops.

Also, random fun fact, Operation OVERCAST was actually a thing IRL and the US millitary did override the president, well slip and slide past him anyway, on that matter.

Oh and something wierd I noticed. When you copy paste things to the text editor, maybe only for large ass posts such as these, some lines randomly get dropped. I think I got them all, but if you see something that's 'wat' tell me please.
