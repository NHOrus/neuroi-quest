###12th May, 1946

"*Zhege tinjang shi Harbin Chenshi! Harbin Chenshi!* This stop, City of Harbin, City of Harbin!"

The mechanical jolt of the train breaks engaging shook Katyusha Zharkov out of her stupor.

Stuffing the book she was reading, a thrice translated novel of some description, into her rucksack, she rose, along with the two Zhongwen passengers sharing her seat. They smiled enthusiastically and gestured at her, offering her space to disembark first. The rest of the carriage did the same, standing, but waiting aside for her to disembark first, all looking at her with various amounts of awe, the usually noisy carriage quiet as they stared at her, eyes filled with hope *turning to despair as she rested her hands upon theirs, telling that easing their passing was the best-*

Blinking away the memory, Katyusha gave the Zhongwen civilians a slightly awkward smile as thanks, then picked up her meagre belongings and walked to the end of the carriage. One of the train conductors entered the carriage again as she neared the end of the aisle, announcing "*Zhege tinjang shi Harbin Chenshi! Harbin Chenshi!* This stop, City of Harbin- ulp!"

Eyes widening on seeing the young, blonde Orussian girl clad in military dress uniform approaching, the Conductor's voice caught. Recovering with a small harrumph, he smartly stepped to the side, entering a pose he probably thought looked like parade rest, then gave a small bow when Katyusha walked past.

Stepping off the train quickly, already tired of the celebrity witches experienced off, and if they were unlucky, on, the frontlines, Katyusha joined the stream of humanity heading for the end of the platform and up the stairs.

Aside from her military dress uniform, she did not stand out. Zhongwen, Orussians and Fusoans all crowded around her, many small time merchants carrying heavy bags of goods as large as they were, eager to enter one of the great Northern Trading cities. Straddling a river and close to the border of two countries, the city was a natural hub of international commerce. The goods and troops from South East Asia in particular, all passed through the city of Harbin to reach the Russian front. With the Neuroi Hive to the South East pushing North and threatening to cut off Eastern Siberia, commerce was at an all time high as people tried and goods flowed back and forth across the straining trans-Siberian train line.

The air was thick with noise, voices of every age and language ringing out. To the side of the platform, hawkers cried out, showing off their wares arranged on the floor or dangling off harnesses attached to their bodies, repeating their products and prices in many different languages. The smell of rotting fruit and homemade glue wafted through the air, adding to the searing scent of hot steel and stench of diesel fumes. The mixture creating a thick, nearly ripe atmosphere that pervaded the crowded station. One of the diesel trains pulled away from the station, mighty engines drowning out the loudest of humanity for an instant, before the hawkers raised their voices above that of the machine in turn.

On the farthest platform, an armoured military train parked, taking on soldiers, mostly fresh faced teenaged men. Younger than any Katyusha had seen on the front. The platform was a mess as sobbing families hugged and waved, handing over enormous lunchboxes that would be lucky to fit on a train table, ignoring the red faced Sergeants bellowing that they get on with it. Katyusha stood by and watched, feeling an immense sense of melancholy at the sight, it was nearly the same that day five years ago when she departed to her first front against the Neuroi. The train finally started pulling away from the station as Katyusha watched, the last soldiers jumping on as the train started, giving a last few frantic waves to their families on the platform. The entire station gave a thunderous cheer, clapping their hands, shaking the roof as the train pulled out of the station. Katyusha silently gave them a salute, hoping those men were prepared for what they were about to face.

Normal business quickly resumed as the military train pulled out of sight. The stairs onto the overhanging bridge were a nightmare. Swinging elbows bumped into her, carelessly swung bags walloped her with body blows and squeaking wheels ran over her toes, thankfully protected by her tough combat boots. For a moment Katyusha considered simply jumping over the crowds and across the stairs into the station plaza proper. Thankfully, before it was necessary, she reached the top, where the stairs widened into the transverse bridge, allowing people to disperse with sighs of relief.

That relief lasted only moments before another wave of human leeches arrived, latching onto anyone who looked remotely unsure of themselves. Self proclaimed tour guides swarmed around lost looking new arrivals, thrusting out broachers and speaking in a broken dialect of whatever looked most likely to be their victim's native tongue.

Pushing her shoulder length blonde hair back into order after the melee up the stair, Katyusha strode forwards. Only one hopeful tour guide approached Katyusha, the others deterred by her uniform. Before he could get word off, Katyusha rapidly clipped out "No. Nyet. Bù yòng. Īe."

The young tour guide shrugged with a small grin and moved on. Katyusha sighed a slight breath of relief, it appeared the advice from her Zhongwen patients on how to deal with hawkers was right on the money.

Checking off her ticket, she headed for inspection, but barely had the time to step in line before a pair of Zhongwen customs officers marched towards her, singling her out.

"Katyusha Zharkov?"

Noting that both were making an attempt to smile, she nodded in confirmation. The one on the right, slightly portly, opened his mouth, then glanced down at her feet and snapped his it back shut. They nodded at one another and the one on the left, thin featured and wiry, smiled wider, "I'm your escort from here to your taxi, right this way please."

Slightly bemused, Katyusha glanced down and realised she had been unconsciously standing on the surface of a dirty puddle of water. Shaking her head, she moved to follow the two officers. Ever since the advent of the Striker Unit, which allowed for the majority of witches to fly rather than only the few, rare immensely powerful individuals, witches across the world had trained to fly. Though she herself was one of those whom had never managed, the instincts from her training still lingered.

Rushed through customs without fuss, she exited the station building and entered the station square. The day was overcast and muggy, but the exhausting weather did little to quench the energy of the newly arrived and soon departing. Even more stands dotted the station square, mostly food to be eaten on the trip, where ever one would head, or beverages to refresh those whom have just arrived. Katyusha didn't have long to enjoy the sights before she was hustled to an armoured limousine, where another two men waited for her inside.

One was dressed in Fusoan army uniform and held a Liberion M42 submachine gun, the bars on his uniform informing Katyusha the man was a corporal, and the other in a well tailored if slightly heat rumpled grey suit, a slight bulge at his side showing he also held a sidearm. Before they could even introduce themselves, the limo took off through the streets, the driver leaning on the horn, forcing pedestrians, bikes, rickshaws and other cars on the roads hurry to make way for the governmental vehicle.

Steadying himself with a sheepish grin the man sitting directly opposite to her smiled and spoke in near perfect Orussian, "Welcome to the City of Harbin. The Harbin City hospital is honoured to host a veteran of combat and medicine as auspicious as yourself. I am Matsuda Yamada and will be serving as your interpreter for the course of your stay. Besides me is Niichi Daisuke, he's assigned as your personal guard."

Katyusha politely inclined her head to both men as she replied, "I won't be here long, but I hope I can help save many lives in my tenure here."

Glancing through the car's thick, tinted windows, she noted armoured cars pulling into formation around their limo, one behind them and another ahead, beetle like with their angled green armour and their stubby mounted machine gun turrets scanning across the Cityscape. The citizenry didn't seemed worried about the machine guns sweeping just above their heads, affording them only cursory glances. Many soldiers passed through Harbin daily, a through fare to the eastern front a bare five hundred kilometers to the east.

That though didn't really explain two armoured cars as an escort, surely that was a bit extravagant thought Katyusha. Yamada the interpreter noted her questioning looks and grimaced, "Security precautions Miss. The Communist movement has been using more terrorism and strikes upon civilians in lieu of their flagging military efforts in the north."

Looking at the city closer, Katyusha noticed. Signs of heightened tensions were subtle but pervasive, and not in the way a that a city at the front should be. Security checkpoints, useless against the obvious Neuroi, littered the street corners, soldiers from the Nationalist army sitting at the sides and keeping a wary eye on the crowd rather than the skies. Occasionally, members of the public were stopped and searched, the soldiers carelessly spilling neatly packed possessions onto the dirt of the street, rummaging through it, then moving on without a backwards glance. Civilians grew sullen, conversations dropping away, rather than cheery as they neared the troops, whom normally a welcome sight.

Some stores were closed, warning tape stretched across their fronts, the glitter of shattered glass and stains of fire smoke telling of the circumstances behind their closure. Harbin was a city under siege from within.

Katyusha shook her head silently at the sight. She had grown up warring against the Neuroi, her parents had grown up warring against the Neuroi, her grandparents had warred against the Neuroi. Only they, the oldest of her relatives, spoke to her of the times when Humanity did not have a common enemy and fought against each other. She knew that even now, people fought against each other across the world.

This was not the news that adorned the recruitment posters, the headlines of the newspapers or was blared across radios. This was news she picked up in dribs and drabs in battlefield clinics, overheard from the curses that soldiers she was treating threw at Hispania, at Zhong Gou and at the Ottomans. Of how if only they were not so selfish that the War would be going better.

It especially perplexed her that such a thing would occur here. Five hundred kilometers was less than an hours flight by a Neuroi large type. If it flew at high altitude, directly in this vector from the Vladivostok Hive, then within the hour Harbin would be a city of fire.

To his credit, Yamada kept up a stream of interesting commentary of the history and development of Harbin from a small fishing village into the bustling metropolis it was now, of the history of trade between Fuso, Zhong Guo and Orussia, distracting Katyusha from her brooding.

Reaching the outskirts of the inner city, their car was stopped for a brief moment at a checkpoint in front of a bridge. The driver simply leaned out the window, and the Nationalist troops waved them on without further checks. Neither armoured car was given even that cursory check, the guards seeming to recognise the escorts on sight.

Harbin straddled the Songhua River at one of the many sections where the river meandered upon the Manchurian plains, splitting and feeding back into itself many times, creating the prime farmlands that fed the city. The main economic and finance centers of the city on the north eastern side of the river, building stretching as high as thirty stories into the sky, clustered close to each other and shining with glass, marble and plaster facades. At the distant edges of the city and along the shore of the river, new fortifications were springing up, builders swarming like ants over the squat concrete structures, yet the girders shining in the sun attesting to their incompleteness. The frantic pace of the construction of city fortifications had slowed when the Neuroi to the south east had shown little interest in Zhong Guo direction.

In contrast to the shiny buildings of the north east, the dark and sullen combined industrial and residential sectors of the City lay to the south west, across the river. A series of bridges, their long support columns resting on the small islands only above water during autumn and winter, connected the two sides of the city. Far dwarfing the commercial districts of the city in area, the residential districts lay low and flat, sprawling across the plains. Amongst the sprawl, the high stacked chimneys belching out black smoke stuck out intermittently, overshadowing the low roofed cheap housing around them. Heavy industry working day and night to send resources both east against the Neuroi and west against the communist forces. Older fortifications dotted themselves through the suburb, which tended to gather around them for the fact that those fortifications also served as shelters should Neuroi attack.

Past another, much heavier armed checkpoint and back the on dry land, the car began jostling slightly, the poorer quality roads shaking the passengers even through the luxurious suspension of the limousine. Katyusha giggled slightly as the armoured car ahead of them rocked up and down on the roads, the machine gun rattling in it's mount. She quickly grew sombre as she took note of the surrounding city though.

As they entered the outer suburbs, the people on the streets dropped off sharply. Civilians hurried furtively along the alleyways and between buildings, the previously omnipresent crowds and street vendors thinning out rapidly. Unlike in the city center, they threw fearful looks at the convoy and withdrew into the shadows as the cars approached. Most notably, she no longer heard the noises of a bustling city filtering through the windows. The citizens of the suburbs were subdued and quiet.

Even Yamada lost his cheer, gesturing to the empty streets, he sombrely said "They would cheer us, but they are oppressed by fear of attack. It is not unknown for communist agents to attack the families of the men whom cheer at the sight of nationalist troops. Even the soldiers of other nations no longer visit the South side of Harbin."

Katyusha sucked in a sharp breath at the thought, she was used to the thought of civilians dying from attacks, the Neuroi never distinguished between soldier and civilians. Many of the devastated towns and cities retaken by the Orussian forces in their marches east and west had cellars and rooms full of carbonised bones, the neuroi having found the hiding civilians and burnt them one and all to ash, but the thought of other humans acting so… inhumane, she could not believe it.

The ride was long and silent from there on, only the rattling of gravel and the hum of the engine accompanying them.

The first thing Katyusha noted about Harbin Hospital was that it was remarkably well established.

Located twenty four kilometers from the river at the outskirts of the suburbs where large scale farmland were beginning to overtake the homes, Harbin City hospital sprawled across the north face of a small hill, encompassing nearly ten hectares within its grounds. Multiple concrete buildings sprawled across the complex, painted white. Situated upwind of the exhaust fumes, its bright facade stood out in the red and grey mud brick constructions on the industrial side of the city. To the west of the complex, a looping rail line extended back down towards Harbin, showing the sheer throughput the hospital could be expected to go through.

Surrounded by a four meter tall wall in a octagonal star formation, sixteen guard towers, seven anti-air batteries and three internal wire mesh fences topped with razor wire and doubtless other defences that Katyusha could not see, it was also extremely well defended, especially for something on this side of the river, though their balance of Anti-air seemed a little too biased towards light weaponry.

Katyusha took this all in as she walked through the third and final checkpoint, entering the hospital grounds complex proper, slightly yellowed grass and flowers overrun with weeds showed that the gardeners here were underpaid. Next to her, Daisuke, their stoic guard, saluted and headed off towards one of the smaller buildings, likely a barracks for the guard garrison.

Honestly, despite the impressive security and gleaming white building, she was slightly underwhelmed at how… empty the hallways of the hospital remained. Maybe it was simply because the hospital was far from the city, it would require years of unmolested development for Harbin to grow the urban centers out so far from the River. She was both happy and annoyed at this. Happy in that this city had yet to feel the ravages of war and annoyed in that she would probably not be putting her talent to good treating those hurt by the war.

It was orders directly from the top. First, the army psychologist had recommended she take a break from the front line clinics. She had puttered in one of the temporary towns far to west, feeling useless until orders came down that she was to be thrown across half a country down to the city of Harbin in Northern Zhong Guo. She had protested at how far she had been sent, but even Colonel General Evgenievich Golovanov, commander of the entire 47th Corps, had held up his hands when she managed an audience with him, replying that orders to reassign any medical Witches that could be spared had come from Marshalrodavoisk Novikov, Commander of the entire Orussian airforce and the witches by extension.

Walking through the main entrance, she continued scanning her new workplace for the next two months. Behind her, the heavy security door closed with a crash that made her jump. A glance back showed a sheepish Fusoan soldier next to the door bowing in her direction, a stone faced superior marching his way.

A slight poke from Yamada got her walking again.

The internal walls were also build to military spec, thick reinforced concrete walls layered over with bright white ceramic tiles, smooth and well polished, which clicked under her boots. The doors were centimeter thick burnished steel alloy, faintly shining under the bright free hanging, fluorescent bulbs. Even inside the hospital, sharp looking guards stood at guard and patrolled in pairs, hands poised on rifle butts and eyes alert, scanning over incoming traffic with diligence that Katyusha had rarely seen since leaving the Siberian front a week back.

Keeping pace next to her, Yamada pointed her around, helpfully handing her a map where he circled points of interest for her. Katyusha could feel her interest wane even as he spoke of the state of the art, but strictly off limits, virology and immunology departments.

A restless feeling boiled in her gut, intensifying as the tour dragged on. The building was too quiet, too still. Something about the air within the facility didn't sit right with her. Yamada didn't seem to notice her increased pace as she sought to get the tour over and done with and do something, anything, people are dying and she was just standing there dithering-

Snapping, she spun on heel to address him directly, "Pardon me mister Yamada, but could I get settled and start treating patients? I… feel useless if I'm in a hospital and not helping in anyway."

Yamada looked over her in sympathy and nodded, "Very well then, Miss. Your roommate and partner has already arrived I believe. Right this way."

XxXxXxXxXx

The apartments for the staff turned out to be a pair of buildings to the east and west of the main complex, attached by short suspended corridors.

"Miss, your room is just ahead. Number 378." With that, Yamada stopped, waiting politely in the corridor for her to get settled in.

With a quick glance, Katyusha took the room in. Located in the western building, it was similar to the rooms beside it, narrow like a sardine container set on its side, barely two meters across, two tall and five long. At the end of the room, a tall window was set, looking directly west and letting light in. In the middle of the room, a small sink sat recessed into the wall, next to which a door was set, presumably leading to an attached toilet. The walls were bare concrete, painted white and the door to the room was thick steel like the other doorways in the rest of the complex. Two beds were in the room, set lengthwise and separated from each other by a small desk.

On that desk lay a small carry bag, similarly spartan in possessions like Katyusha's own. The owner was a short Asian girl, also clad in her army dress uniform, struggling with the window at the end of the room. Giving up, she turned around and spotted Katyusha.

For a moment, the two medical witches looked each other up and down. The other girl had dark brown hair stretching slightly longer than Katyusha's own, hanging down to her shoulder blades. Her frame was slender and of indeterminate age but from her face, decorated with thin and sharp features, Katyusha guessed the other med witch was older.

The other witch broke into a pleasant smile, and introduced herself in slightly stuttering Orussian, waving a lazy salute, "I'm Kunato Minori. I was from the Siberian front, thirty fifth medical battalion based off Sakhalinsk, Sakhalin oblast."

Katyusha gave a informal salute of her own as she made a guess and answered in her own, passable Fusoan, "I'm Katyusha Zharkov. Siberian front, medical battalion one zero one, based off Blagoveshchensk, Amur oblast."

Neither gave their ranks. It was an unspoken rule in the medical witches that ability and experience conveyed seniority rather than rank. A rule that frustrated many political officers, whom used their pull to send their talented daughters to 'safe' posts such as medical witches to gain political points, and whom then could not continue to pressure the medical officers corps to keep their daughters in cosy terminal line positions.

A moment of appraisal later, and both witches extended their hands for a firm shake, recognising their mutual experiences and hardships.

"Partner?"
"Partner."

"Pardon me miss."

They broke their handshake. Looking to the doorway in askance.

Yamada was standing at the door, looking grim. "We have new patients, ICU. The faster we get there, the better."

The two witches gave each other a single look, then took off running, followed closely by their guide.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Left turn ahead."

"I had thought the hospital was yet to open." Guards ahead of them hurried to push open a pair of thick metal doors.

"Straight at the intersection."

"I felt the same, the hospital felt too empty."

"Not only that, but no guidelines, no signs. Easy to get lost, poor design."

"What do you mean?"

"Buildings this big have little hints to where you are. This one doesn't. Paint's the same everywhere."

"That is strange, this hospital is new though, maybe they will add those details later."

"Door to the right, ICU Seven."

The two witches slowed, walking through the door at a good pace rather than a flat sprint. Hurrying excessively and running over a patient never helped. Behind them, Yamada collapsed to the ground, wheezing at keeping up with the pace of the witches. He managed to give them a thumbs up before the doors closed.

A medical orderly approached, gesturing impatiently for them to follow, handing out smocks, facemasks and hairnets. While a witch could easily eradicate a bacterial infection, there was no need to make their own job any harder. The only differences between their protective clothing and that of the mundane surgeons was that med witches wore no gloves, it was always easier to use magic with less between witch and patient.

Katyusha could feel her own back straightening as she shrugged off her dress blazer and equipped her surgical gear, this was no field clinic like what she was used to, but here, she could feel good, she could be useful.

Marching in step, the two witches entered the surgery room.

It was crowded.

At least a dozen unconscious girls, bleeding from their abdomens and pale from blood loss, were arranged through the room. Distributed among them were seven orderlies, working feverishly to stabilise them. The operating lamp had been broken into basic three light arrays to ensure there was enough light for each of the patients. The smell of anaesthesia and disinfectants was strong in the air.

Without a word, the pair of medical witches reached the first patient. The orderly stepped aside, relief evident in his voice as he reported "Heavy damage to internal organs, there may be a few missing entirely, heavy blood loss, they all came in stabilised with the wounds magically closed but they're reopening."

Katyusha placed her on the girls diaphragm and began a scan. The internal injuries were massive, lacerations on intestines, missing at least half the liver, one kidney, sections of cervical spinal cord severely damaged, sever blood loss, three breaks in the pelvis… and she was a witch too, probably what kept her alive long enough for first aid to stabilise her. Katyusha rapidly listed off the most grievous wounds, confirming the diagnostic of the orderly. Nodding, Minori placed her hands over Katyusha's and began channelling magic into the girl.

In the eastern front, medical witches had developed a system where they work in partnerships of two if at all possible, colloquially known as a delver and a healer. The delver was usually the more adept of the two in using magic, diagnosing the most severe injuries and directing the healer to where best concentrate her magic as well as concentrate on miscellaneous tasks not directly connected to healing such as anaesthesia and sanitation. The healer was usually simply the girl with more magic reserves, using raw force to repair more grievous injuries. The delver would then work after the healer, 'fine-tuning' the healing and confirming that no oversights existed. As witches worked through the day, they generally changed positions several times, the delver switching with the healer to let her magical reserves recover, before the they would switch back after a period.

When they had shaken hands a minute earlier, they had gauged each others magical power. There had not been a significant difference, but Katyusha had felt that she had been behind in both categories, so she had volunteered as the delver.

Minori worked eyes closed as she directed her magic, humming slightly while Katyusha observed, sweeping over the healed regions for mistakes and observing the method by which Minori healed. It was always interesting for Katyusha to see the differences in technique of med witches. Katyusha had learned that her own style of healing involved using magic to encourage the body grow replacements for damaged sections while breaking down and feeding the displaced cells within the body to the newer tissue as fuel, something which appeared to be a fairly general style of healing.

Minori's technique was completely different however, she used her magic to take over the cells of the body itself, repurposing them as needed, Katyusha watched in shock and wonder as blood cells, which had been pooling within the body, changed in structure and function, forming bone and bone marrow and cartilage, reforming the shape of the spine in an instant. Just as quickly, the blood seeped into the spine, forming nerve cells, reconnecting the spine. The new nerves spasmed, and Katyusha broke off from her observations to concentrate on anaesthesia, she knew from experience that the agony from the nerves reconnecting themselves would have been extreme, enough to cut through chemical painkillers.

By the time the nerves had settled down, Katyusha having pulsed a few bursts of magic through the repaired spine to make sure no wires had been crossed, Minori had repaired the liver and was resettling the pelvis. Even as Katyusha ran her magic through the liver to check its integrity, she marvelled at the healed organs, it was an unprecedentedly powerful healing technique. Even with simple observation, she could tell of how efficient and fast it was, but with the same glance, she could tell the amount of finesse required would be beyond most witches. If only she could have used such a powerful healing technique, how many lives could have been saved…

"Katyusha."

Snapping her head up, she looked into Minori's brown eyes, "We should move on, life threatening injuries have been dealt with."

Recovering quickly, Katyusha scanned the patient again, despite being there as Minori finished her treatment, for surety. Still missing one kidney, lacerations on intestines repaired, other internal lacerations were sutured but not repaired, damage to dermal layers sutured but not repaired. If Katyusha left these kinds of injuries for later, they would result in massive scars, but with Minori's ability, not even scars would remain. The tradeoff between possibly losing the life of another patient and less time spent unconscious for their current one was not even with considering, "Agreed. Patient is stable."

As one, they removed their hands and moved around the table to the next girl. They washed their hands clean of blood and once again, began the operation.

XxXxXxXxXx

Katyusha and Minori sat back against the wall, both magically exhausted. Even with her magically efficient technique, Katyusha had to take over as healer for Minori for the last pair of girls. With a sigh, Minori slid to the side and leaned against Katyusha. Katyusha startled slightly at the unexpected contact, and Minori pulled herself upright before Katyusha could relax into the gesture.

"I can't believe they were all witches…" said Minori as if she hadn't just been snubbed.

Glad for something to say, Katyusha nodded drowsily and said, "What was being done to them, those wounds were not made to kill, it was like, it was uh, what was the word… harvesting."

Minori hummed in agreement. The surgery for the twelve patients had taken them almost five hours to complete in total, it would have taken longer if the injuries had not been so discriminate and specifically limited. Still, the grateful orderlies had needed to support the pair of witches as they staggered out of the surgery room, barely having the composure to wash their hands and discard their smocks and hairnets. It was already an improvement for Katyusha, she hadn't passed out in the middle of her operations.

Inside the ICU, they could hear the orderlies talking along with the squeak of wheels as they wheeled the patients out of the emergency surgery room and presumably into observation and recovery rooms.

"That is unfortunately close to the truth miss."

Katyusha lolled her head over to the source of the voice. Her guide, Yamada approached, wheeling over a cart.

"Those girls were kidnapped from their villages by Neuroi cultists, they were in the middle of being ritually sacrificed as offering to appease the Neuroi when they were rescued." he said.

Minori twitched at that, "Zhong Guo has Neuroi cultists who go as far as sacrificing witches? Do they have a death wish? I can't believe that such a thing even exists."

Yamada nodded in sympathy, "Even the communists do not suffer their existence where they rule. Of course, that doesn't stop them from attacking the witches in the nationalist armies by any means, including attacking the families of those girls. Both sides are similarly despicable."

"…but what am I saying when you two are so exhausted after your hard work. I brought a late lunch to you two. You witches must be hungry after working for so long." Yamada neatly changed the subject.

He extravagantly flipped off the top of the cart, displaying two trays stuffed to the brim with servings of food. Reaching under the cart, he then retrieved two collapsible chairs and unfolded them with a theatrical flourish, setting them down next to the cart, creating a impromptu dining table. Katyusha clapped appreciatively, then caught herself, hiding her head in embarrassment at the slightly bemused looks the hospital staff walking by gave her.

Minori chuckled at her, then leveraged herself up "I'm Kunato Minori. Thank you very much Mister…?"

Katyusha's guide hesitated for a second, seemingly thrown off by Minori's switch to Orussian, "I'm Mitogawa Yamada, Miss Katyusha's guide."

"Ah, I thought your name was Matsuda Yamada." said Katyusha as she sat down.

Next to her, Minori giggled as she settled down in her seat, "No way Katyusha, you must have heard him wrong. Matsuda Yamada? Those parents would have to be cruel indeed to name their son that. Thanks for the food, let's eat."

XxXxXxXxXx

What do you make of their performance
It's… extraordinary. Thirteen Two is above average already, but Thirteen One… you were right to call her a miracle worker.
On this note, you still hold the opinion that it would be best that she not be brought into the fold?
I… no, yes. Yes she needs to be kept in that dark. Now more than ever. She's too foreign in her values now, we should have kept her closer to the home islands…
If we had received news of her skills earlier, we would have. Regional command is similarly infected with foreign sentiment.
Gods and Nation, if only we knew earlier…
It's too late now to change our methods, if Thirteen One was onside earlier, perhaps then…

XxXxXxXxXx

It was late afternoon when the two girls stumbled back to their room. Yamada left them at the door, assuring them that if needed, they would be called through the telephone on the desk set before the window.

Minori started retrieving her items from her carrybag, then paused and turned to Katyusha.

"Which bed would you like?" she asked.

Katyusha instinctively looked at the bed closer to the door, her experience urged her to take it, anything to shorten the response time to a crisis. The she looked at the second bed, closer to the window. Out the window, the view to the west was beautiful, the sun was edging closer to the horizon and they were far away enough from the factories that the constant smog was lighter. Their elevated location allowed them to see the river as it wound down through the plains from the distant mountains, just barely visible over a layer of cloud, creating a breathtaking vista that she had only seen in previously in paintings.

It was flat terrain out there, an open plain. Dangerous, exposed to air. No cover anywhere, extended lines of sight. A neuroi flew across her field of view.

Magic flooding through her body, Katyusha took several steps back, then closed her eyes and inhaled slowly. When she opened her eyes, she could see it was simply a hawk.

Just a hawk. Just a hawk. Just a bird.

"The one closer to the door, allows me to get out of the room quicker… and it's further from the window."

There was a moment of silence after her words.

"This is not the front anymore, it's alright." said Minori.

Katyusha turned, Minori was walking towards her with a gentle expression on her face. Katyusha saw too much understanding in Minori's eyes for her comfort. Stepping firmly back and looking down she muttered, "I'd still like the one closer to the door."

Minori stopped, awkwardly shuffled, trying to find words, then giving up, she placed her own belongings down on the bed closer to the window.

"We can switch at anytime you want alright?"

Katyusha silently nodded, not looking back out the window and into the distant, red, setting sun.

Red like the Neuroi.

Red like blood.

XxXxXxXxXx

The two medical witches settled down on as much of a pattern as medical witches could keep after the somewhat frantic first day. Despite being nominally on vacation, they still kept their battlefield habits.

In some ways, it was everything that Katyusha thought a vacation would be like, her laundry was taken care of for her, the food was plentiful and available everyday and the toilet always flushed.

In other ways, it was very much same as still being on the front for both her and Minori. They still slept whenever they had the time to, resting to restore magic. Whenever they were not sleeping, treating patients or resting, they shared notes on healing techniques.

Whereas Katyusha used a fairly common healing technique that Minori grasped easily, Minori's own explanation for her advanced form of healing flew over Katyusha's head. The greatest barrier between the lay in the language barrier, many words and technical terms simply beyond either of their rudimentary grasps of each others language. They had given that up until they had more free time to explore those theories in depth, instead simply talking about their lives.

Whereas Katyusha had spent basically all her life on the front, Minori was well travelled, "I have been to Harbin before you know, back then though there wasn't an economic district on the north side, just a large town on the south side of the River. The factories and fortifications are new too. It's amazing what just six years can do. It's a pity we're so busy otherwise I'd want to show you around the city and see what's changed myself."

Katyusha nodded silently as she listened, she loved listening to stories of other parts of the world, a habit she had developed in the clinics listening to her patients as she treated them.

Before, she could ask more about Zhong Guo though, the phone rang. The two witches shared a slightly exasperated smile as Katyusha picked up the phone. No doubt another batch of patients.

It was not that the witches preferred being busy, simply that their schedule didn't allow them to relax.

Injuries waited for no one.

XxXxXxXxXx

Do you believe you can replicate it, Ichi?
Sorry daddy, I can't understand, she keeps switching to that other language too.
What of you Nii?
I… I'm sorry but-
No matter. It appears that we need to arrange have to you all view it in person.

XxXxXxXxXx

"I had thought that I could actually find regular sleeping hours on a vacation." murmured Minori, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as the two once again ran through the featureless corridors at three before dawn. Another day, another operation.

They carried between them their guide Yamada, who despite having a rough stubble and frizzled hair was still dressed in his rumpled grey suit, which rapidly gained new creases as he called directions from between the arms of the two witches.

Katyusha had wondered if the man slept in it.

"It's better than the front, quieter, but still, you'd think at a major hospital like this they'd phone in incoming patients so we wouldn't have to keep running out with barely enough time to pull our pants on."

They shared a smile at the slight joke, a poke at the habits born out of necessity that many of their flying compatriots developed.

Leaving the slightly green Yamada outside ICU Four, they entered reaching by habit for their surgical gear.

Within the ICU was another scene of carnage, one that both witches had gotten used to over the course of the last week. This time the patients were a mixed bag of men, presumably nationalist troops and two more witches. Honestly, Katyusha wasn't sure that their thoroughfare was actually any lower than what she went through on an active battlefield, even one as heavily contested as the city of Blagoveshchensk. Mostly due to the fact that the injured tended to be from shrapnel and secondary exposure. She could count on one finger the number non-witches she had seen directly exposed to Neuroi lasers, and survived the trip to a clinic alive.

As they approached the first patient though, she noted an anomaly. To the side of the operating theatre, there stood an entire squadron of Fusoan witches. Not unusual, they'd encountered other med witches and strike witches posted here, though they all worked different shifts, lived on different floors and some in the other wing, so extended conversations were impractical. What set these witches apart was that they were young, even by the standard of witches. Katyusha honestly wasn't sure if any of them had broken their first decade, something blatantly illegal on paper.

She met Minori's eyes with an silent question and the other witch gave a slight shake of a head in response. She didn't know them either.

Dismissing them from her head, she approached the first patient, then stopped dead in her tracks. A man, probably in his early adulthood, lay facedown on the gurney. His back was a patchwork of black, purple and red, the skin and flesh sloughing away to reveal the deathly white of exposed bone underneath.

Wincing slightly, Katyusha reached down and delved, placing her hands on the man's exposed ribcage and spine, ignoring the slight squishing of the exposed muscles. It wasn't that different from the severe burns she had treated.

"…Dermals layers on back completed ablated away, bone damage from thoracic disk three to disk eleven, nerve damage from cervical disk five to lumbar disk three, severe microbial infection. Moderate but extensive organ damage from infection. Infection has yet to reach patients brain."

Katyusha paused, she gave the other patients within the ICU a brief overview. None looked to be in such a bad condition as this patient, but if they took too long healing this one, that could change, complications within the other patients piling up as they dealt with this one. It's what she hated most about delvers, their responsibility to call if a patient was to be saved or discarded as a lost cause. Sometimes the best thing you could do was hold somebody's hand as they died, sometimes that was all you could do, but maybe, just maybe, you could die here, with me?

Throwing away the memory, Katyusha looked up at Minori, hoping the more experienced witch would make the call instead. The other witch stayed silent, looking back, trusting her to know their abilities well enough to make the call.

Katyusha took a steadying breath, "He can still be saved."

With a resolute nod, Minori reached down and began the arduous process of healing.

Katyusha made to join the dive, then noticed the young witches on the periphery of the room approaching.

"Stay back, it's dangerous."

Experienced med witches could be trusted to keep themselves and their patient free of infection, but these witches were anything but experienced from Katyusha's eye, they fidgeted and looked at the medical equipment, almost seeming to struggle to hold back from running their hands over everything, almost as if it was their first time in an operating theatre.

They all stopped and in eerie synchronisation, replied, "Sorry, we're hoping to learn how to save people with infections like that."

Katyusha hesitated, Minori was completely absorbed in her healing, and for injuries of this magnitude, Katyusha would be needed, she didn't have time for this.

"Just, just make sure you keep your hands clear. I'll look over each of you after this to make sure you're all clear."

She turned away, diving into the delve, noticing with a distant irritation how each of the other witches ignored her and immediately placed their own hands on the patient.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Object lodged between clavice and first rib." muttered Minori, eyes fluttering as she struggled to stay awake. She had taken over delving. It was their third shift between roles during this exhausting ten hour operation.

I should have discarded the first man, Katyusha thought sourly.

He had taken an age to stabilise, and the other patients had indeed developed complications despite the best effort of the mundane medicine as the med witches were occupied. It had also unnerved and irritated her to see the wing of young witches simply watching them intently and silently through their operations, but not attempting to help. An irrational anger seeing how their inexperience would have likely caused more trouble than they were worth but Katyusha was not used to seeing anyone within an operating theatre whom was not making any attempts to help whatsoever.

Those young and unnaturally silent witches had only left within the last hour, ignoring Katyusha's demands for them to stop and be delved to make sure they weren't carrying any of the diseases which ran rampant through the patient group. She had been too tired to insist.

Katyusha edged the obstruction free of the upper rib cage with magic, then reached in and plucked it out with her fingers, working to close the incisions over the upper chest. As the last cut sealed, leaving behind thin white scar tissues, Katyusha pulled away with a gasp.

Her whole body ached with the effort of standing bent over for so long, her magic typically used to reinforce herself repurposed for healing.

"Looks like a scalpel blade."

"Muh?"

Minori was swaying slightly as she washed her arms clumsily. To the side of the basin in the tool tray, the obstruction lodged in the patient's collarbone lay. Underneath the thick red blood, the silver glint of stainless steel was visible.

Katyusha thought about it for a second then nearly passed out on her feet, "We could, we'll talk about it later."

Both girls barely made it to their rooms before falling right into bed. Katyusha though jolted back awake as Minori also collapsed into the bed closest to the door, that is, her bed. A poke didn't get response but a slight snore. Getting up with a slight grumble, she moved to the other bed, the beds at the hospitals were far too thin for two people, they'd kick each other off while asleep for sure.

Her eyes closed as soon as she hit the mattress, uncaring of the mid morning light peering around the edges of the window blinds.

XxXxXxXxXx

Katyusha had lived on the battlefield for more than half of her life. At first, as a refugee constantly moving East with the others after her home city was burnt to the ground alongside her parents.

After months of the harsh winter, she discovered her own magic after waking up next to the thin, cold corpses of her grandparents. With no one left, she had wandered to the nearest military camp. Unsure of how old she was and owning only the clothes on her back, she simply told the conscription officers she was ten, just at the age where witches were legally required to join the military. They gave her a purpose.

Recruited into the med corps after failing the Striker aptitude tests, she then spent six long years on the battlefield, shifted all over the country as lines pushed back and forth, rear lines becoming front lines and then recaptured daily. She had trudged over and over again through the burnt cities decorated with the melted remains of tanks and guns, above the ashen remains of the long dead and over the still warm bodies of those recently deceased, until they were ground into dust and kicked up into the air, mixing into the fog of war to hang in the sky and paint everything grey, the only colour on the battlefield left being that of the red of the Neuroi and the red of blood, always somewhere nearby.

In those six, long years of war, she had never treated injuries of the type that she saw in her first month within the Harbin City Hospital. Chemical burns of every kind, bodies ravaged with viruses and bacteria, bodies with their internal organs removed with near surgical precision.

Every time, at least one member of those young witches were watching from the sidelines. Finally one day they had approached and asked Minori for lessons on how to heal. Katyusha guessed they were simply very shy and awkward, she had been the same.

Despite the fact that there were more witches whom may learn Minori's astonishing method of healing, it left Katyusha feeling rather down as now, she spent most of their awakened hours alone, without anyone to talk to. The witches had finally learned how to proceed to ICU seven and the mess hall by themselves, after weeks of following Yamada's directions through the featureless, windowless hallways, but he still shadowed them when possible to prevent them from getting lost just in case. In any case, wandering the blank and repetitive hallways trying to explore was uninteresting and unproductive, most of the time, as soon as she ran into the guards, they would flatly instruct her to return to her room, the one time she had protested, they had remained silent and called Yamada, whom after discussing something with the guards in rapid Fusoan, led her back to the room with a regretful smile, explaining on the way.

"I'm terribly sorry Miss Katyusha, the guards are simply paranoid after the attacks on the city led to all those patients you were treating yesterday, well… earlier this morning to be accurate. They're nervous due to the high amount of communist infiltration reported throughout the city. That is in fact one reason there is a Fusoan garrison in this city at all, we were asked by the Nationalist government to be here."

"Why are there more and more patients everyday? I thought we would be treating long term injuries from previous attacks, but it's ICU patients every time." asked Katyusha.

"Um, those latest patients were from a apartment block adjacent to a military barracks, canisters of poison gas were left within the barracks and drifted into the apartment, downtown Harbin is in chaos right now. The, uh, communists have changed their method of attack into being less discriminate now they have more agents in the city." answered Yamada as they walked past another ICU room, empty at the moment, he glanced in, seemingly distracted, before moving on.

"Then surely we should be called up to help correct? I have not fully recovered, but if we were deployed on site we'd prevent most of those from even needing to be transported here." said Katyusha, again looking for something to do.

"Right now other witches are on shift in this hospital, leave the incoming injured to them. As for going out for onsite help, that's out of the question I'm afraid. It's too dangerous. A pattern has recently emerged of witches and other young girls disappearing throughout Zhong Guo. The Neuroi cults thankfully are not that extensive… but that leaves only one power capable of kidnapping at this scale."

Katyusha hissed a breath at the hint present Yamada's words. Biological and chemical terrorism within such an important trade city whilst the Neuroi were right next to their country, kidnapping witches to do God knows what with them. The Communists had changed much. The Zhongwen soldiers she treated always spoke of them, if not fondly, with a grudging respect, but now… were the Communists even human?

"Right now we have another clutch of patients entering, they have severe infections from a bomb sewn within a diseased animal carcass hidden in a military supplies truck. In addition to the Neuroi cultist whom are still hunting down rural witches as part of the blood sport they call a religion, it's lucky that we've received as many experienced med witches as we have." he continued as they reached the adjoining corridor between the two buildings.

"No doubt, more injured will arrive with your shift, so please, rest yourself and prepare." Yamada said as he left her at the door to her room.

Katyusha sighed and flopped onto bed, maybe she should try sleeping for more than six hours at a time, she heard doing so was very relaxing…

XxXxXxXxXx

The bombardment was relentless, the heavy shells of human artillery arcing overhead, shaking her position. Katyusha didn't not falter, even as the surgical lamps burnt out, casting the field hospital into darkness. Her hands were buried in the guts of the injured soldier in front of her. Every time she moved, fresh, vibrant blood pumped up, drowning her fingers as she methodically found arteries and veins, sewing them back together with magic.

"Katyusha!"

Someone called for her. Couldn't they see she was working?

The shells landed closer and closer, shaking the tent more and more severely. The overhead lamp array flared to life for a brief moment, throwing the scene into stark relief. Blood was splattered all over the pallid corpse, overflowing onto the gurney. The spilt blood continued to glow, a dull, thick red that seared her eyes even as the lamp flickered out again.

"Katyusha! Wake up, we have to go!"

The red glow of blood brightened, the thick, sticky fluid spreading across the floor, crawling up her arms.

"Two more minutes." She replied, her mouth felt clumsy, the words didn't come out right. It didn't matter.

Refusing to turn around, Katyusha now worked frantically, reconnecting muscles and ligaments, undoing the sutures to allow blood to flow back into the healed organs. A burst of magic restarted the heart.

"We don't have two minutes, c'mon!"
The heart of the patient restarted, but the beat was irregular. Much too strong. So strong it shook her, even though she was standing next to bunk. His arms snapped up and grabbed her shoulders, shaking her more severely.

The vibrant red blood now covered her throat, running up face. Beneath her, the Neuroi she had been treating loomed above her, blocking out the ash choked sky. Jet black and glowing red, it dripped the blood of slaughtered humans down onto her face. A second pair of limbs tore themselves from its shoulders and reached for her throat.

She choked on the blood of others.

"Katyusha!"

"I'm up..." said Katyusha groggily as she sat up.

"I'm up!" she repeated as she swiped at her eyes, wiping away the wetness. Minori took her hands off Katyusha's shoulders and ran out of view at that, satisfied that Katyusha was lucid. Hastily pulling on her boots, the other witch was out the door almost before Katyusha could swing her legs from her bed. "ICU stat!"

Katyusha didn't bother with her pants, simply throwing her jacket over her shoulders and ran after Minori.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Hold her down! Where is she injured?"

She arrived to a scene of chaos. Beds were upturned, groaning orderlies slung over them. In the corner, on the one upright gurney, Minori struggled with a patient. Katyusha quickly ran forward to help, tying on a hairnet and facemask with the speed of experience.

The patient was a witch, delirious, screaming like a banshee as she fought against the hospital orderlies. Magic flickered, wild and untempered, and two men flew back away from her. Blood poured out from her mouth, staining her pale hospital smock red.

Fusoan words rang out between the orderlies and Minori, too fast for Katyusha to decipher.

"Her tongue? How by God and nation did someone rip her tongue off? Katyusha, check."

Katyusha secured her facemask and took her cue from Minori. She strode forwards, pining down the patients shoulders and upper arms. As she did so, she used a delve. Wildly rampaging magic, messily severed tongue, moderate blood loss and moderate contusions in wrists and ankles and… no other injuries? Strange. Katyusha scanned again to be sure and confirmed. Very light injuries compared to what they were used to, but now was not the time to wonder about that.

Looking up, she nodded sharply to Minori, confirming the diagnosis. Nodding back in turn, Minori looked down and concentrated, hands clasped over the cheeks of the patient, concentrating on the most immediate injury.

For a moment the patient relaxed, her wildly screams settling down. Then her eyes found and locked onto Minori's face.

Katyusha had exited the delved and turned her head away to direct the orderlies so she wasn't sure what happened.

One moment she was asking for a towel and warm water, the next, something stuck her in the chest and she was on the floor, pinned under a cursing orderly and the gurney they had been treating their patient on.

Shaking her head clear, she gingerly shifted the flailing man and metal framed bed off herself.

The patient was straddling Minori, hands wrapped in a chokehold around her neck. She was leaning forward, roaring into Minori's face, using her entire body weight to keep the med witch pinned down. Blood splattered down across Minori's face from the patient's still healing tongue.

For a moment, it was Katyusha pinned and a neuroi looming above- This was not the time! Katyusha picked herself up and started running over, ready to knock the patient out if necessary.

"-yingwei nimen rebenren zai shasi si women! Wo de mama! Wo de baba! Jiejie he meimei! Tamen doh si le! Nimen kewu de wangbadan ba tamen cong jia limian jwa chulai ranhou dou shadiao le! Ranhou ni! Shi ni burun women si! Shi yinwei ni-!"

The patient twitched, her rant cutting of abruptly, then sagged, falling. Katyusha rushed forward and caught her before she hit the floor as Minori rolled away, wheezing and massaging her throat.

Suddenly the patient's hand spasmed, then shot up, grabbing Katyusha's collar. She pulled herself up, glaring into Katyusha's eyes. Her eyes seemed alight, there was a manic strength in them, Katyusha gulped as the patient stared at her, grinding out three words in Zhongwen, "Wo… hen… nimen!"

With that, the patient fell back and relaxed in her arms, going limp. Katyusha stared down at the witch in her arms, what she had just been saying… no she must have heard wrong.

She reached for Minori's bruised throat, but the other med witch waved her off, sitting up, the deep purple wounds already disappearing from her skin. Coughing once, she gestured at the patient "Had to knock her out, is she alright?"

Professional as always, thought Katyusha as she scanned again, "Yes, still some minor blood loss, but she will recover in time with her own magic. No other injuries."

The other witch stood up with a groan and righted one of the gurneys, before moving on to check over the still staggering orderlies, absently fingering the blood sticking to her hair. Katyusha picked up the patient and set her down on the gurney, then brought over a pail of warm water, a towel and another hospital smock as she set to work cleaning up the patient.

"You speak some Zhongwen right? What was she yelling after we regrew her tongue?"

Katyusha paused. The wet towel dripped water across the patients chest.

"I… didn't hear clearly."

She must have heard wrong. Yes, it was just the shock from the being thrown. She could not have heard what she thought she did.

Wait, Thirteen Two can speak Zhongwen as well as Orussian and Fusoan?
Not good, distract them, don't let Thirteen Two think it over.
With what exactly?
Make some new patients.
What, but we agreed to minimalize casualties!
…Fine. Test Koschei derivative three on the patient.
Inside the upper levels? You're insane.
Derivative three only has a lifetime of nineteen seconds and Thirteen One needed to work with it sooner rather than later.
But even so, right next Shift Thirteen with no warning-
Thirteen One can handle it. I recall you were the one who insisted that she be kept in the dark.
…I protest this decision.
Noted.

The pair of witches had only just healed the last orderly of his broken bones when Katyusha noted an odd pulse of magic run through the room. Next to the doorway, Minori jerked, showing that she also noticed something.

Turning, Katyusha saw a horrendous sight. The patient was thrashing under her restraints, eyelids fluttering, her magic going insane under her skin. Black lesions started appearing on her body, spreading from her left foot up her body.

It was rapid. Fast at a pace that she had never seen, and from Minori's alarmed gasp behind her, neither had the other witch.

Katyusha ran over and placed her hand on the girl, starting a delve-

Then wrenched her hands back with a yelp as pain flared in her palms.

Even as she watched, black lesions, the same ones covering the girl beneath her shoulders to toes, appeared on her palms, spikes of agonising pain, like barbed wise being drawn through her flesh, flared and died down. She could feel her nerves dying as whatever it was spread from the patient to her hands.

Katyusha instantly worked to contain it, cutting blood flow and trying to find whatever it was eating her alive. Her magic jumped, irregularly pulsing through her body. Whatever it was, it was interfering with her ability to control her own magic.

"Stay still."

A hand laid itself over her neck.

"Wait Minori, don't touch me, whatever it is-"

"Spreads through contact, not limited to organic material, I know."

Minori's magic flooded through her, darting around the advancing tide which had reached her elbows. Beneath her, the patient was already a sunken black mess where a healthy girl rested only seconds earlier. Katyusha numbly noted the time of death and watched as the table started sagging, the same black marks running through the steel. It was eating the steel itself and… a thin black smoke was rising from the corpse, forming a faintly visible dome.

It was spreading through the air.

Katyusha gulped. Whatever it was had nearly reached her shoulders, her arms black and sagging like rotten fruit. With a odd sense of detachment, she estimated her chances of survival of whatever this was at less then a single percent, even within a medical facility.

"Run Minori, I'm done. You need-"

"Shut up."

Katyusha stooped talking, the gurney in front of her was a heap on the floor, pooling outwards to touch her boots, where new black tendrils coiled up the tough leather of the boots. Now she wouldn't be able to kick Minori clear without possibly infecting her too.

Minori was muttering furiously behind her, speaking too fast for Katyusha to make out what she was saying.

Then a surge of magic.

For a moment, Katyusha felt a moment of numbness through her body as the blackness touched her spine. Then it was gone. Completely purged from her body.

Minori dragged her back, away from the pile of slime that was the patient and the gurney. "Wait-" choked out Katyusha, "It's on my boots, don't touch them!"

Katyusha's arms still hung on, the flesh distended and bleeding, the bones turned to mush inside and her boots now had holes decorating them, but none of the blackness remained.

"Don't fret, I got this." Minori walked past her, practically blazing magic, towards the slime pile, still oozing the deadly gas which marked the walls, eating into ceramic and concrete indiscriminately. For a moment, Katyusha wondered how on earth Minori wasn't a strike witch.

Her warning died on her lips as Minori plunged an arm into the pile of slime.

A huge blast of magic and scalding air threw Katyusha back, slamming her into the wall.

The shock on her already damaged system was too much and she passed out.

XxXxXxXxXx

Incredible.
…That was far too close, what would you have done if Thirteen One touched the vector first?
Thirteen two always, without exception, delves first. As you could see, even if Thirteen One had contracted Koschei, she could have countered it before any ill effect occurred to her.
You are being far too reckless, that gamble could have cost us everything.
But it paid off, Thirteen One can directly manipulate Koschei, fruition of our plans is just around the corner. Project 731 can succeed. We will win, the nation is saved.

XxXxXxXxXx

With a gasp, Katyusha woke up.

She blinked at the piercing overhead lights, trying to turn over. Her arms were aching, a thousand pins and needles running through them…

Her arms!

She lifted them, clenching her hands, moving each digit individually, channelling magic through them.

Completely healed.

No, brand new. The damaged tendons and faint scars on her arms were gone, every single cell seemed vibrant.

"In-incredible…" Katyusha whispered, raising them to the ceiling, holding her hands against the light.

Someone else's arms reached past her shoulder, grabbing her own with a firm grasp, entwining their fingers.

"Thanks god, you're alive, you're still here…" a muffled voice rang out from behind her.

With her head buried into Katyusha's shoulder, Minori was leaning back against the wall of the operating theatre, holding Katyusha on her lap.

"Minori?"

Katyusha tried to turn around, but Minori crossed her arms around Katyusha's belly, holding her from behind.

"Wait, don't go yet." Minori's tone was forlorn, and Katyusha halted, then relaxed back into Minori as the other girl tightened her grip.

Katyusha sat there, waiting for the other girl. After a mere couple of minutes however, Katyusha was fighting the urge to squirm, Minori was holding her too tight. She was sure she'd be bruised at this rate.

Minori shuddered silently behind her, once, twice. Rhythmically.

Katyusha settled back, soothingly stroking Minori's hands with her thumbs.

She could live with a few bruises.

XxXxXxXxXx

By the time they were let out of the room, Minori had calmed down, a slight flush to her cheeks all that hinted to her slight breakdown.

Apparently no one had come to the door when they knocked as they had been held in quarantine. Yamada had babbled something about a new communist bioweapon but Katyusha had been practically dead on her feet, she wanted nothing more than to collapse and sleep for a full eight hours.

"…please help us, we desperately need any information possibly as how you managed to neutralise the weapon."

Katyusha snapped wipe awake at that, "No! She barely had two hours of sleep between our two last operations. Combined that with whatever she did to burn that thing from me and regrow my arms she'd be near the edge of magical exhaustion, push too far and she may go into-"

Minori's arm gently landing on her shoulder stopped her. The other witch smiled, "It'll likely be just theory work, I won't have to do much actual magic, don’t' worry."

At this, her gaze turned determined, "Besides, the sooner I can find a way to stop that- that thing, the better."

With a swish of damp dark hair, she was walking away with a gaggle of scientists, she called back to Katyusha, "I'll find a way for us to wipe that abomination out and be back by dusk."

XxXxXxXxXx

Minori was not back by dusk.

Katyusha prowled through the complex like a cat, the entire building seemed to be empty today. Even the guards were sparse.

Not even Yamada, usually on the phone in seconds when she used the building's internal line, picked up.

Despite that, the outside of the building seemed busier than ever. Convoys of trucks and cars swept in and out of the facility, even the rail line was used, a train pulling in as Katyusha woke up at midday and again at dusk. Katyusha could not see anything with the way the windows were orientated and walking had proved fruitless as even the doors not guarded by silent, stone faced men were locked.

How by God and Nation did they expect her to respond to emergencies if there were so many unattended doors left locked?

More than ever, the strange atmosphere in the air intensified, malicious, wrapping around her, choking. Katyusha struggled with the window some before giving it up as a bad joke, there seemed to be no way to open it to let in fresh air. Katyusha felt a chill at that thought before shaking her head. Most military specification bases she visited didn't even have windows, she should be glad for the view.

Her shift over at dusk without a single call or sign of Minori, Katyusha threw herself back into the thin mattress of her bed and sulked for an hour, doing her best to ignore the smell, which had thickened almost into a taste, before falling asleep.

XxXxXxXxXx

Following is an analysis of Koschei strain XK-Seven, codenamed KANNAGARA
Brief:
As noted, Kannagara is stable and discriminate unlike previous strains of Koschei. This allowed for stable storage of large volumes within non sanctified containers for an indefinite amount of time. Kannagara shows high potential customisation for any given range of targets, or even singular target application.​

Specifications:
Lifetime: 88.2 seconds.
Resultant of units produced per mole: 1.8637×10^50 units.
Resultant final volume of expansion per mole: 1.381×10^19 cubic meters
Resultant radius of effect of one mole: 2977km
Units required to destroy targets in area 5km in radius: ~2.0229×10^21​

Current storage:
Currently there are only approximately one trillion (10^12) units stored with the Children of Heaven as first stage test are underway.​

Production:
Knowledge and ability to produce Kannagara is currently restricted to the Kempeitai unit: Children of Heaven and Agent: Omoikane. A condensed debrief of the method of manipulating magic and matter to create Kannagara from Koschei strain PLUTO is currently impossible. See attached file: <Omoikane Method> for details.
Currently maximal production is plateaued at 8×10^9 units daily. However, with increasing knowledge of the <Omoikane Method> it is estimated that full scale production of Kannagara will approach 10^25 units yearly.​

Testing:
Deployment of XK-Seven was conducted in three separate sites at the request of the allied party Kai by Unit 516.
In all cases, Kannagara was delivered through flyover with the container set with a timer.
Full documentation attached in file <Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Equipment Trials>​
Relevant notes:
The explosive dispersal of Kannagara created a larger area of effect than intended. Suggest aerosol deployment in future.
No counters were devised by the witches within the sites for Kannagara deployment.
Single plane magical barriers ineffectual at halting spread.
High temperatures (est. 35,000K), low temperatures (est. 0.1K), kinetic impacts (est. spc. impulse 110,000Gs) and electrical currents (est. 515MW) ineffective at impeding Kannagara's spread.
Direct magic exposure extends lifetime of Kannagara. Suggest creation of incubator witches to carry Kannagara in active form to approach targets for fail-deadly guarantee.
Typical time to exposure to assured death was 2 seconds.
Typical time to die from Kannagara's direct effects was 5 seconds.​
In conclusion:
In all three cases, the resultant disintegration of hostile elements within the 500 meter kill radius without the damage of economic resources or creation of residual dangerous elements presented satisfactory results. Further research is heavily encouraged.​

Katyusha pressed down on a limb which stretching towards the air, asking for salvation.

She pushed harder and with a creak of brittle bones breaking, the body packed into the corner of the body bag. Trudging to another of the thin, burnt bodies that littered the ground, she grabbed it and shoved it into the body bag, then slung it over her shoulder as she walked towards more bodies. She didn't feel any guilt for savaging the dead, the bodies far outnumbered body bags. This held true even though if there was one thing that was a positive about the war with the Neuroi, it was that there was very little to bury from the aftermaths of heavy laser strikes.

"Is that what you think?" her friend and former partner Latrova stuck her head out from within the body bag, throwing a friendly arm over Katyusha's shoulder. She had always been a little too touchy feely for Katyusha's comfort.

"Oh? But you liked hugging and close contact? Did I, what was the word again, ah, "cause a severe case of post traumatic stress" in you?" Latrova lost her balance as Katyusha leaned over to collect another body, spilling out onto the ground, crumbling to ash as she hit.

"Was I hard to bury Katyusha?" asked a charred fragment of a jaw, the biggest piece Katyusha had found of Latrova, still glimmering with her magic.

No, said Katyusha, you were within the primary radius of a heavy laser strike from a large type.

"Ah, that's one thing I made easier on you at least…" the jaw fell silent, and Katyusha threw it into the bag after a slight thought.

Most struck by Neuroi large types directly were ashes adrift in the winds, settling down on those alive, embracing those who stepped over their graves, uncaring. They never needed body bags. Their names were roughly carved into the slag of their rifles, of the slag of vehicles they rode, as impromptu graves. Their earthly remains often amounted to just molten metal, like metal tears, their vehicles and guns crying for their users where their comrades had long run out of tears. Those metal tears ran into the ground, carrying their earthly remains into hell as their souls rose with their ashes into the skies.

Those in the edges of the resultant fireball were flash baked, clothes melting as men and women popped open like corn kernels, insides steaming as it expanded past their burst shells into the open air, grotesquely displaying how they were cooked through to any who would look. Katyusha hated those ones, they were always thrown the greatest distances, their body parts covering the greatest area, it was hard to collect them.

"Aww shucks," one of the bodies chuckled, pieces rattling across the dirt floor, "I thought you liked us too, what with the first time you saw something like us you cried so hard, even though you were lucky to survive being that close, yourself."

Shut up, snapped Katyusha as she collected the pieces and stuffed them into the bag, I was young then. I had hopes too.

Those affected by the tertiary effects were the ones that Katyusha gathered at the start. The men knocked down by the shockwave and radiant heat, unable to get away as their clothes and their surroundings lit alight, burning alive slowly. Muscles contracting as they dried out, forcing them into the fetal position, creating a illusion of seeking safety from the heat even after they were long dead.

One of the curled bodies stood up and stretched, ash flaking from it's skin, "Oh I don't know about that, you kept me alive for ages, just my heart and brain, magically re-oxygenating what blood I had. God and Nation, I hated you and everything in the world by the time I died. What were you saying the whole time? 'I can do it, this injury is nothing. I can bring back the dead'? My little girl, you gotta lower you own expectations of yourself."

The popping of flexing joints sounding like that of a merry camp fire. Katyusha silently gestured at the bag. It smiled up at her with shrivelled lips before crawling forwards, tumbling into the bag, "I didn't mind at the end though, I died in an important battle and held the hand of a beautiful girl as I passed on, she even thinks of me after my death. That's the dream of lad who enlisted."

The corpse paused for instant, staring at her from within the bag with haunting blue eyes, "Well, maybe without the whole dying thing."

Its voice faded away as Katyusha zipped the bag up.

Something was wrong though. The bag dragged heavier and heavier on her shoulder, the zip broke and bodies spilled out, those she had discarded in treatment. Their viscera flowed out in a great rivers down her body, rising up in a red tide and choking her with its smell, its taste, its feel.

The smell of death.

Katyusha sneezed, waking herself up.

The smell of death. That's what it was, the same smell… no, the same feeling filled the hospital air she was breathing.

Turning slightly, she looked over at Minori's bed. It was probably around midnight.

Still empty.

Katyusha lay there alone. Awake.

XxXxXxXxXx

May 27th, 1946

The sky was just turning yellow as Katyusha snapped her eyes open. She hadn't managed a wink of sleep since midnight.

Swinging her legs over the side of the bed she stared at the window frame. It was a sturdy but simple hinge design, the bottom of the window capable of swinging outwards and a latch handle to stop people from pushing them open accidentally. However, it looked like the edges had been welded together for some reason.

Katyusha rubbed at a finger nail, she hadn't trimmed them for a good while now, then looked at the welds running along the edges of the window. Steel welds, tougher than normal but her magically reinforced nails were strong enough for this.

Clunk

"дерьмо́!"

She hated this smell.

Clunk

"жо́пошник!"

She hated this room.

Crunch

"муда́к!"

She wanted to get out.

Crack

"су́кинсын!"

Outoutoutoutout-

Finally with a crack of snapping welds, the window gave way and extended out… fifteen centimeters. For a moment, the smell of industrial and human waste, of the river and the plains, reached her nose.

Living smells, not that of the dead.

Then the internal air circulation systems that kept the air within a hospital at higher pressure than the surroundings kicked in and the fresh air was blown away.

For a moment, Katyusha pursed her lips at the window. It may be bullet proof, but she doubted it would stand a couple of good punches. A voice in the back of her mind cautioned that she may have been going slightly stir crazy.

Then the clunk of the door opening behind her caused her to spin around, a denial of damaging the window at the tip of her tongue.

Kunato Minori walked in, head hung.

"Minori! Welcome back." exclaimed Katyusha, walking forwards.

The other girl looked up. Her face was pale and drawn, she simply stared forwards, past Katyusha.

Katyusha slowed, hesitant, "Minori? Are you alright? Did something go wrong?"

Minori eyes focused on Katyusha's face, searching, suspicious, before she closed her eyes and collapsed onto the bunk burying her head in her hands.

"I… wrong? Go wrong. Something… everything," Minori trailed off into incomprehensible whispers.

Katyusha hesitantly sat on the bed next to Minori, leaving a half meter of space between them. The other girl had fallen silent, staring listlessly at the ground. The uncomfortable moment stretched longer and longer. Katyusha fidgeted, she noticed her fingernails were torn and bleeding then healed them. Minori stayed silent and still for moment longer, then turned and looked at Katyusha directly in the eye.

"Katyusha, what would you do, if you learnt that the Neuroi all through the world were actually humans? If behind the black armour of every Neuroi flyer and every walker was a human, like… like the way we wear uniforms." asked Minori in a quiet, but intense voice.

Katyusha ran the question through her head, not understanding. What would she do? If the Neuroi were humans all along? … It was too absurd an idea for Katyusha to wrap her mind around, what did Minori even mean? If such a thing was true…

"I… I don't think anything would change, I'd keep trying to heal people on the battlefield. If I met a neuroi who, who was actually a human, I wouldn't be able to see them any differently… they're still Neuroi after all, they've killed so many, destroyed so much…" said Katyusha hesitantly.

Minori flickered her eyes over to Katyusha, apparently thinking the response over.

"What if I then told you, that your officers, the superiors who gives you your orders, they were Neuroi? That the moment that you turn to head for the battlefield, they would shed their human guise and turn into Neuroi, to kill other humans."

"What are you saying Minori? There's no way! Just no way! No way! I wouldn't believe you!" cried out Katyusha, jumping to her feet.

Katyusha couldn't take it.

This tiny little room, the narrow window which was her only view of the outside world, the consistently irregular hours, the abnormal injuries which she had never seen before, the hundred odd patients everyday, almost dying, the isolation of having only one person to regularly talk to, the isolation of that one person appear less and less and the feeling that her one confident might have gone crazy before she herself did, it all poured out in that one shriek.

Minori stayed sitting, "Katyusha. That night yesterday. After we healed her tongue, what did that girl yell at me?"

"-because of you Fusoan are killing us! My mom! My dad! My sisters! They're all dead! You fucking bastards stole us from our homes and killed them! Now you! Its you who won't let me die! It's because you-!"

"N-No…"

That scalpel piece broken off in the man's clavice bone. The limited and surgical wounds. The patients, always just barely alive. The consistently recent injuries.

It couldn't be…

"Are… are you saying- Are you saying that we- this hospital!-"

"Katyusha, this is no hospital. This is a bioweapons factory."

Katyusha's legs gave out from under her.

All those she treated.

"You won't let me die!"

They were tortured, guinea pigs used over and over…

"I... hate... you!"

"b-but we never saw them again how-" whispered Katyusha, wringing her hands as they trembled, a weak denial.

"Multiple shifts of med witches, all on different floors, we never see them at the mess hall, we were never treating the same batch of pat- of victims." Minori said flatly.

A hole opened in her stomach pouring in acid and bile, Katyusha barely had time to turn over and grab her hair before retching over the floor. Half digested food spilled over the ground.

It looked like the flesh of the victims she had treated.

The memory made her retch again and again, even after there was nothing in her stomach.

Coughing miserably Katyusha held her stomach, her head spun in confusion. Her entire world had just been turned upside down.

A hand was patting her back soothingly. Minori was on her knees in front of her, mindless of the pool of vomit, "Katyusha, get up, we have to take action."

"...how?" Katyusha whimpered, "We can't even report them, th- the Fusoan army is in charge of this hospital. The Zhongwen army… they must know and they're not doing anything about it! Liberia and Orussia are in the East and the forces from the Southern nations don't stop in Harbin to the front."

"There's one more force here Katyusha, the only one we can trust." Minori gently cupped Katyusha's face and wiped away the vomit stains.

"There's not much time. Now, do you trust me Katyusha? Do you trust me completely?"

Katyusha weakly nodded. If there was nothing else in the world was true, she still would trust her partner.

Minori closed her eyes in thought, then leaned forwards, touching their foreheads to each other, "Then let me in."

And-and-and

Lights, feelings, her own face, magic pulsed in time with the heart, her own, (own?) face.

What was this?

It was-

It was like a delve, but so much closer, so much more intimate. At the edges of thought, she could feel infinity. A voice (voice?) speaking out kept her anchored though.

Katyusha, wait for (an image of a clock, its seven hands pointing at five numbers each) then run for the (a series of images blazed past, fast, but slow, a path through the white hallways that terminated at the upper stairs lobby the one place in each story of the building that had a window) I will meet you on the way.

Katyusha understood.

Minori pulled back, and Katyusha was herself again.

"You understand right?" Minori asked, her expression concerned.

"I… I do." Katyusha breathlessly nodded, she could feel a clock counting down in the back of her head and a map showing her exactly where she needed to go.

She also understood, but distantly, what they had wanted with Midori. Katyusha also knew exactly what Minori's plan is, steal secret documents by the dozens and hand it over to the communists. The Nationalists would be at the very least forced to distance themselves from this travesty, halting its operations which worked with the sanction of Nationalist forces, or face an overwhelming revolt through all of Zhong Guo.

What technique by God and Nation had Minori used to communicate all that so quickly?

Minori stood up, turning (molecular breakdown) the vomit on her knees and one the floor into dust with a sweep.

"Be ready then. When someone comes to look for me, say you didn't see me." Minori turned and exited the room.

XxXxXxXxXx

Katyusha lay on her bed, fighting to stay still. After an entire after an entire night of doing so, and a hidden clock ticking down in her head, she was having a hell of a time of it. Still, she lay silently under the sheets, she had wrenched the window back closed so that if someone checked at the door, things would look perfectly normal.

The phone, set on the desk between the two beds, rang.

Katyusha stiffened. She wasn't ready to talk to someone, she could just pretend to be asleep- no, she had never been a heavy sleeper.

Reluctantly, Katyusha let the phone ring two more times, before reaching over and picking up the headset.

Trying her best to sound tired, she deliberately fumbled and dropped it once before bringing it to her mouth.

"Hello?"
"Miss Katyusha, good morning, apologies for waking you up so early, but have you by any chance been visited by Miss Minori?"

It was 'Yamada'. Katyusha gripped the phone tighter. Under his normally steady and smooth tone, he sounded slightly breathless. Making sure her voice sounded slightly slurred Katyusha replied.

"Minori? No? She hasn't been back, I think…"
"Ah, I see, my apologies, but we're hoping to meet up with you both for a matter of some importance. I will be up to your room soon, stay there please."

The phone hung up before she could say anything else. That was abrupt, the man was rattled, but this could be a problem. The clock counted down in her head.

Katyusha got up and dressed, thinking quickly. It was nearly the appointed time when she had to leave to meet up with Midori, but it was too early to alert the complex yet by rabbiting. Her best option was to drag her feet and break free on the way.

Katyusha looked around, how would she create some time though?

A mere minute after the call, impatient knocks rattled the door.

"Hold on a second." called Minori

As she expected, they didn't.

The door opened and Yamada walked in, catching sight of Katyusha, not even half dressed. He turned about face and walked right back out, closing the door behind him.

"My deepest apologies for that Miss Katyusha, I was too hasty."

Thankfully it looked like they still didn't know that Katyusha was aware of the true nature of this facility. Not even bothering to hide her smirk, Katyusha called out at the closed door, adding some embarrassment to her voice, "I- I'll be out in just a minute."

Katyusha was slow as she dared as she buttoned up her dress uniform. Leaving the laces on her boots untied, she walked up to the door, then turned the handle, hopping on one foot.

Outside, Yamada and four dour guards stood. He gave her a smile that did not reach his eyes as he bowed, offering apologies.

Waving them off, Katyusha hopped along, tying the laces of her boot. Yamada, obviously in a hurry, had to slow down to allow her to keep up her hopping pace. They would have travelled far quicker if she had tied her boots inside then walked out, but she banked on them not knowing that she knew that.

Finally managing to tie her laces, she walked at their previous pace, ignoring the hints that from her escort that they wanted to speed up. All the while, the countdown in her down ticked down, alongside with a separate one as she counted the distance from her room, of when she would need to break away.

One of the armoured doors came into view, no guards thankfully.

The leading guard pulled a keychain off his belt. Katyusha felt a ball of unease form. The keys were all unmarked, the moment the guard let go, Katyusha wouldn't be able to pick the specific key out of those dozens that hung there. Most would be fakes, designed to jam into the lock upon turning, difficult to free unless you knew how. Minori did not know how, that was something she never got to ask the warden she had treated. She had to break free from this group before then.

Twenty meters to the door.

Katyusha almost started there but the faint tapping of feet behind her caught her attention. Someone was shadowing her group at a distance.

Fifteen meters to the door.

Faint steps but a rapid pace. For a moment Katyusha hoped it was Minori but quickly dismissed it. Minori was shorter than Katyusha but she wasn't short short.

Ten meters to the door.

It was probably one of the child witches that lurked within the Operating Theatres, watching them work.

Five meters to the door.

How would she deal with the witch? Katyusha wasn't so naïve to believe she was a master of combat despite her long service and watching other soldiers box.

They stopped in front of the door.

The witch was almost certainly carrying a radio, if she wasn't dealt with, at best the other witch would follow and report where she was, at worst the other witch would take her down.

The door opened, one guard holding it open and one walking through. Katyusha walked forwards.

How. How to deal with the other witch?

Yamada walked through the door next to her. The other two guards stepped forwards. The first guard waited left of the door, ready to rotate with the doorman to be the new pair of rear guards.

A gamble. Katyusha took a breath.

The two guards stepped through, the guard at the door turned and started pulling the heavy steel door closed.

Magic surging through her and using her body to block the motion from view of the two walking through, Katyusha stepped left towards the first guard, brushing almost languidly upwards with her left arm to touch his cheek.

He spasmed and started collapsing.

With a kick Katyusha seemed to slide across the floor with a pirouette, Yamada was just turning his head as Katyusha's fingers brushed against his neck. His eyes rolled up into his head.

The pair of guards hadn't had time to separate yet, after coming through the door. They were fast, eyes wide, both managed to bring a hand up to their slung rifles and open their mouths to shout before Katyusha's hands clamped over their cheeks, muffling any sounds as both were knocked unconscious.

Katyusha let both men go as the doorman turned, about to seal the door with one hand on the handle. He stopped the door with a heel though, leaving some space before it closed. Did the pursuing witch not have a set of keys? It was good for Katyusha at any rate as the man didn't even have time to look up before a gentle palm over the temple had him falling towards the floor limply.

The first of the guards Katyusha knocked out hit the floor with a slight thud.

Katyusha quickly grabbed the unconscious men and slid them to left side of the corridor.

She stood next to the door and waited, closing her eyes as she listened to the approaching steps.

The witch was running now, steps closing quickly.

The door handle turned as someone on the other side pulled on the handle. A hand rested on the doorframe edge to increase leverage. It was small, delicate. It fit the frame of one of those child witches.

A shoulder appeared as the witch started edging around the corner. Katyusha reached out, grabbing the hand and violently pulling, simultaneously firing enough knockout magic into the other witch to knock out an Afrikan elephant. It was enough to give an adult man instant cardiac arrest.

No dice.

The other witch's magic surged against the intrusion. Katyusha would have to channel for at least a couple of seconds and there was no way she'd be able to keep her grip for that long.

Well that was fine.

Putting her whole body into it, Katyusha continued her pull, wrenching the other witch around the corner, reaching out for her ear with her right hand.

The other witch moved to counter, but with her arm resting on the handle of the door moments earlier, couldn't make it in time.

Katyusha plucked the earbud off the witch and completed her spin, throwing the other witch down the corridor.

Slipping through the door in time to see a shield forming as the other witch airbraked, she kicked the heavy door closed, leaving an indent in the steel and causing a crash loud enough to cause her ears to ring slightly.

She turned and sprinted, crushing the magic earbud between her fingers. As useful as it would have been, they were designed so you could be tracked through them. Great for air wings scattered in the chaos of battle, detrimental for her.

She sprinted down the corridor, the countdown ticking down in her head.

XxXxXxXxXx

Katyusha sprinted past her door and the alarm clock in her head fell silent.

Alarms screeched throughout the complex to replace them. They had found out, either the group that she had disabled calling it in or Minori's break in had been discovered.

She was late, only by a dozen seconds, but it was enough to galvanise her into sprinting harder. There was thankfully no one in the corridors, (they had been busy elsewhere.)

The map in her head ticked off her progress.

Minori said that she would meet her on the way, where wasn't specified, but Katyusha trusted her, she continued running.

To her side, a dark blur approached, Katyusha glanced over as Minori pulled in her pace, running alongside the Orussian, a small carrycase tucked under her arm. Clashing with the mutilated lock sitting on top of the case, golden filigree and decorative jade adorned the case. Someone had a taste for avarice.

"This way" called Minori.

Security was beginning to appear in the hallways, (but they were almost all gathering towards the stairwells). The men in their way barely had time to call and order to stop before the two witches blew over their heads, leaping over the few surprised guards that appeared.

[SIS 15R Open Channel]
'Overlord, this is Hawk Actual. Hotel Two is sounding up alarms and their local garrison is deploying.'
'Hawk Actual, copy. Can you see a reason?'
'Overlord, Negative. I will continue observing.'​

Leaping against the wall to turn in time at the intersection the two witches sprinted onto the final straight. Ahead, the corridor opened into the (third floor lobby where one of the three only windows in the main building looked outwards down onto the front lawn. Below, a series of parked cars whom never had their keys removed rested ready to carry fast messages).

From one of the side corridors, another series of blurs shot out at them. More of those child witches. They were racing for an intercept course, but the rows of chairs impeded them.

We are going to make it.

"Man down! Medic!" a shout rang out in Orussian.

The next second seemed to pass very slowly for Katyusha.

Every inch of Katyusha's conscious mind screamed at her to keep running, that it was a trap. Minori's hand tightened as she glanced over in wide eyed worry. She also knew exactly what that call was.

Instincts born and honed through six years of serving as a med witch could not be so easily denied. Katyusha's body moved on its own as she planted a foot and turned to look, bleeding her speed away. She barely had the mental coherence to let go of Minori's hand before one of the trio of child witches slammed into her stomach in a flying tackle.

"Run!" shouted Katyusha at the hesitating Minori.

Their eyes met. A moment of mutual understanding.

Minori sped back up, another one of the child witches barely missed her with a tackle, slapping the heel of Minori's boot with her fingertips.

Katyusha and her attacker slammed into the into ground, sliding through the rows of seats like a bowling ball through tenpins.

"Kusoooooooooo!" With a screamed curse at the heavens, Minori jumped through the window. The corroded metal frame gave way easily as the witch expanded a gliding shield and flew.

Katyusha herself had finally slid into the wall at the side of the lobby alongside her attacker.

She pushed hard at the other witch but the smaller girl seemed to flow around her arms, blitzing past Katyusha's guard with a punch, striking her chin hard enough for Katyusha to see stars.

Katyusha rolled away, stumbling to her feet, still disorientated.

Where was the other witch?

An arm, thin and strong like a steel bar wrenched around her neck. Katyusha dipped her chin, but it was too late. The arm pulled back and wrenched against her neck. Katyusha tried prying the arm free, but it did not give a centimeter.

Bloodflow, airflow, nerves were being compressed-

She would fall unconscious within two seconds.

With a choked cry, Katyusha jumped straight upwards.

A crunch of breaking concrete announced them slamming into the ceiling, her attacker taking the brunt of the impact. The chokehold slipped for a moment then tightened again. Concrete dust accompanied the two witches as they fell to the ground.

Spinning, Katyusha jumped backwards at the wall this time. The other witch realised what was going to happen and tried to get out of the way. She nearly made it, except Katyusha was still gripping onto her arm.

With another crunch, the pair of witches slammed into the wall. The arm loosened.

Katyusha swung wildly, aiming an elbow at where she thought the other witches head was. Dazed as she was, the other witch still ducked the blow, scrambling away, leaving Katyusha's right elbow to crater the wall with a bang.

A spike of pain told Katyusha she'd broken something in her arm, but before she could attempt to diagnose it, movement in the corner of her eye had her spin around. Catching a rifle butt with her left hand, she swung out a low kick instinctively.

The man's shin bones exploded outwards, tearing through the tough fabric of his army uniform as he spun in the air from the force of the kick, both legs horrendously mutilated. Completing his spin by slamming headfirst into the ground, his neck bent at an unnatural angle with a crack. The rest of his body followed, collapsing limply, a bag of meat, already tenderised and with the bones removed by the butcher.

Brown eyes, set into a face as expressionless and anonymous as the first time Katyusha had seen him, the body of 'Niichi Daisuke' sprawled on the ground looking up at his killer, a thin trickle of blood ran down his face from where his forehead smashed into the floor.

Katyusha swayed. Her chest hurt as she struggled to draw in breath through her constricted larynx. Her vision narrowed and colour bled from her view.

Niichi Daisuke Vladimir Russov grinned up at her, the red lines of blood running down their unnatural angle of head not at all impeding their speech, "I thought you said you'd never take another person's life choirgirl. Just a shove too hard, just bit too much magic and us meatbags get cut like leaves of grass."

No… I wasn't meaning to…

"How high does that put your count now? I think you've broken into the four digits choirgirl." the body of Vladmir Russov stood up, heading rolling around on the shoulders as he bent over to pull his pants up, "This time it's your first deliberate killing. Shouldn't we do something to celebrate?"

Eyes, completely red from burst internal blood vessels, looked lifelessly to the side as the body staggered forwards, the Neuroi pushed her down, choking her, dripping down blood onto her face.

"That… was then…"

"Pardon me?" questioned the Neuroi. Katyusha punched upwards, through the body, grabbing the core, and crushed it.

"This is now!"

Gasping as she healed her trachea, Katyusha's vision swam back into focus.

Only seconds had passed in the real world. Around her, three witches stood, slightly crouched, ready to pounce at any moment. The one on the right looked winded and was covered with concrete dust, angry red claw marks decorated her arms where Katyusha had desperately pulled at her. Throughout the lobby, more and more soldiers were pouring in, rifles raised as they arranged themselves through the room, most barricading the broken window.

For the moment, they stood back, warily eyeing the body of Daisuke bleeding on the floor. Standing in a corner of the lobby, meters away from any exit, Katyusha knew she was trapped. She could only try and buy time for Minori now.

Going into a crouch, she glared at the assembled soldiers, "I know how to fix you, I know how to take you apart. Come forth if you dare."

The expressionless men raised their guns. The trio of witches pulled out clubs. Katyusha charged forwards.

Katyusha slowly woke up. The sounds around her were strange and unusual, echoing back and forth. Her vision was blurry and her left eye was stuck closed. A persistent headache throbbed. Pain surged through her body as she tried to move.

Delve.

Skull fracture, blood clot pressuring brain tissue, left fibula fractured but not broken, fingers on left hand broken, left Achilles tendon severed, pelvis broken in two locations. Moderate haematomas over approximately half of body, moderate lacerations over torso and right arm. No internal bleeding in any form. No damage to nervous system.

"Daddy, that thing is awake."

Heal.

Her brain was first, dissolve the blood clot. The headache lessened and Katyusha could think clearly again. The second most disabling injury, the break in the pelvis, shift the bones back into alignment-

A painful grinding sensation, like nails were being hammered through her hips, caused Katyusha to gasp. Fighting down the tears, she forced the bones back into place, fusing them. She had forgotten to use anaesthesia, she was too used to working with a partner-

Partner.

Minori.

The hospit- prison.

The escape attempt.

Blows raining down on every part of her body.

Angry voices, a brief healing.

The sound of an engine.

Snapping her eyes open, Katyusha frantically looked around.

She was sitting in a car, arms bound across her chest and legs bound in thick steel manacles, centimeters of steel wrapped around her wrists. Something metallic was shoved into mouth also, set between her molars. It was preventing her from properly closing her mouth. There was something about the metal of the restraints, the metal itself felt magical. (She had no doubt the metal would be far sturdier than just its material strength.)

Sitting opposite to her, one of those child witches pressed a rifle bayonet lightly against her chest. The threat was obvious. Next to her was a Fusoan soldier, furrowed brows resting under curly hair. His face was slightly plump and a similarly curly beard decorated his chin. Despite lacking obvious ranking insignia, he was clearly of high rank. His dress uniform was stark white like the British Admiralty, golden epaulets sat upon his shoulders, the light green glow of Jade buttons ran up and down his sides. He leafed through a thick binder of paper, motions precise and measured.

"Who are you?" Katyusha voiced was slightly slurred from the gag.

He flickered his eyes upwards, the cold, compasionless orbs lingering on her for a moment, then dismissing her, he looked back down.

"I am the Director of Harbin City Hospital. That's all you need to know. Ichi, knock it out again. Gently please. I don't want to hear its voice."

"Yes daddy!"

A movement to her side. Katyusha turned her head as something struck the back of her neck. A surge of foreign magic shocked Katyusha's system. Her vision faded back into darkness.

'Overlord. We are unable to get close enough to the Mark and Jane Dee.'
'Copy that Hawk Two, Hawk Seven. Two continue shadowing Jane Dee. Seven, follow the Mark. '
'Overlord the convoy from Hotel Two have just exited their vehicles. Wait one. They're dragging with them a restrained witch. Orussian from the look of her uniform.'
'Copy Hawk Actual-'
'Overlord, they're broadcasting something- I- this is bad, I'll relay- "Kunato Minori. Give yourself up. Listen to us, the work we do is for the good of all! Even if logic does not appeal to you, give yourself up for your friend. If you do not, the consequences for her shall be dire!" … and now they're repeating the message.'
'I copy…'​

"You cannot be seriously planning to go back out there. You were the one who was there. You know that they won't keep their promises!" the Zhongwen witch was furious, gripping onto Minori's arm with a death grip, stumbling over the unfamiliar language. She'd only learned a bit of Fusoan for one person, and that one person seemed determined to commit suicide.

"None the less Liu Xin, I should. I was complicit in their murder after all. Just make sure you get the word of what are doing here out." Minori calmly extracted her arm. She slowly smoothed the creases out of her clothes.

"You will be capture and they will kill her Minori! If you care about her, you should stay. Either way she will die." Wang Liu Xin jumped in front of the doorway, a last ditch effort to block the way, but her heart wasn't in it.

"Xin. Favour to an old friend. If I… die. Please, try and save her." Minori stared at her, eyes silently pleading.

"I… very well, I will consider it." Liu Xin felt the words stick in her throat. She couldn't meet Minori's eyes.

'Overlord. This is Two. Charlie is going crazy. They're moving through all their underground passages. I think it's runners.'

'Hawk Two, Hawk Seven, Copy. Seven, I'm on the Mark personally, head for the convoy.'​

Katyusha once again woke up, this time, her head cleared itself very quickly though.

"…the current stratagem is impossible to sustain. Our country may be burnt to the ground the very next day. Hundreds of millions depend on us."

"Even should the human race be saved through your methods, history shall still judge you as a cur."

Katyusha shot up straight. Minori!

She was in the suburbs of Harbin. Grey brick buildings surrounded the small town square. Still manacled, she was being held from behind by two of those child witches. Beside her, the Director was swivelling his head, searching. All around her, soldiers stood, rifles readied.

"We are so close. With how much time and effort, with how many lives have already been given to the cause, it is your duty to make their lives meaningful!"

"Duty… Absurd. Those lives were not given to you, you took them and had them slaughtered. If your intentions were as pure as you claimed, why did you create a strain that would target humans? Announce your project to the world, free the captives, ask for volunteers. No more lies. Those are my conditions. I refuse to be complicit in more murders with that abomination."

Minori's voice seemed to ring out from every direction. Katyusha looked left and right, but couldn't pin down a source. Several more of those Child Witches returned from those side buildings, shaking their heads.

[SIS 15R Private Channel]
Janissary… what they're talking about…
There's no mistake. It's the MORRIGAN project.
Did Orussia break the Dresden Agreement?
Maybe more countries than just Orussia…​

The Director paused, seemingly considering his options. He gave a dramatic sigh.

"Very well. Looks like logical negotiations have broken down. Nii?"

The witch to Katyusha right withdrew a pair of pliers. She grabbed Katyusha hand and locked them over the nail on her pinky.

A shock of magic racing through her system disrupted the painkilling magic Katyusha was holding.

The moment after, the pliers moved. Ripping away her nail.

Refusing to scream, Katyusha hunched forwards. The witch moved onto her ring finger, grabbing the nail.

"Wait, stop! Are you refusing to consider my conditions at all?!"

"Kunato Minori. I have the will of all Fuso and the World behind me. It is you who is the one refusing to accept my conditions."

Another burst of magic, disrupting her own. The pliers ripped off another nail.

Katyusha couldn't hold it. A scream ripped itself from her lips. Worse than the pain was the knowledge that they did not need to do this. The witches holding her could have magically simulated her nerves directly.

The pliers ripped the nail of her middle finger off.

Katyusha wailed, instinctively trying to shrink away. Her teeth gnashed at the metal bit, if it wasn't there she may have bitten off her own tongue.

They could have used magic, but they didn't. This entire production was so that Minori could see it. They were torturing both of them at the same time.

[SIS 15R Open Channel]
'Fuck this! Overlord. Lets go in. We can save them! We save them and grab intel at the same time!'
'Negative Hawk Two, do not expose yourself. We will not win.'​

"Stop! STOP! I'm coming out."

Katyusha, gasping, watched through blurry vision as Minori seemed to fade into view.

"Now. Release her. Release her and I go with you."

Six of the child witches rapidly made a loose circle around Minori leaving two holding Katyusha up and one standing next to the Director. The man nodded to the two witches holding Katyusha, "Nii, San. Undo her restraints. Keep you hands on her though."

The metal manacles and the bit slid off. Katyusha forced magic into her own body again, forcing herself to stand upright. The two witches next to her still held her hands behind her back.

"We will let her go the moment you let yourself be shackled. You will not get a better deal." the Director said.

Minori looked at the surrounding witches and the dozens of soldiers. She slowly put her hands into the air.

The child witches moved in, grabbing her arms, they locked them behind her back. Minori shifted uncomfortably as the witches then manacled her legs and stuffed the bit into her mouth.

"Okay Daddy, we got her." one the child witches called out cheerfully.

"Excellent, now, Roku, call base, tell them we need to arrange for another pair of witches to fill in shift thirteen. Private, shoot this one, we no longer need her-"

Minori roared in fury, leaping forwards, barely wrenched back the surrounding witches. Magic crackled around her manacles, shrinking back from the ensorcelled metal.

"YOU SCUM! YOU PROMISED!"

"She knows of your method of matter manipulation and has contacted with Koschei. She may well be able to recreate for the communists or another nation in time. I will not allow those selfish fools to gain control over such a weapon. Only we have the foresight to use it responsibly." the Director said, tone casual, as if discussing the weather.

Minori howled, shaking her restraints. She bit through the metal gag, fragments of metal falling from her mouth, "DON'T YOU DARE!"

Katyusha tried facing her death with dignity, but tears leaked from the corners of her eyes. She was so scared.

The director spared her a single glance then pointed at one of the soldiers next to Katyusha, rifle already raised in anticipation for the order, "You, shoot-"

Minori stomped hard at the ground. With a boom, poor quality brick cracked and flew up. The Director turned, wide eyed.

A kick launched a brick right at his chest.

One of the child witches swiped at it, missed. The director moved incredibly quickly, twisting to the side. Fast as he was for a mundane, he couldn't avoid it. The brick smashed into his right hand, the crack of breaking bone and snapping tendons sounding out as fingers flew off, severed by the force of the impact. Spinning around with a yell of pain, clutching at his mutilated hand, the Director fell.

"How dare you hurt daddy!" The child witch on Minori's right kicked her hard in back of the knee.

Minori collapsed. She looked up at Katyusha.

A gun pressed against the top of Minori's head.

Minori smiled slightly, mouthing something.

Bang

[SIS 15R Open Channel]
Fucking hell! They fucking shot one of their own med witches! They're going to shoot another, I'm going in!
Hawk Two, do not! Repeat, do not-! Hawk two?
Overlord. This is Hawk Actual, Hawk Two is currently indisposed. We will continue observation.
…Copy Hawk Actual.​

For a moment there was silence. Minori slumped, her head dangling limply as blood poured from her neck.

Katyusha felt something inside herself go numb, cooling rapidly.

The Director stared, pain and shock on his face plain for once.

He turned to Katyusha and her captor, "Nii, release her. You. Heal her. Now."

Then the Director strode forwards and slapped the girl whom had shot Minori across the cheek with a metal lash. A small speck of blood flew. The witch gave a cry of pain and dropped Minori's body, which sagged down. A puppet with its strings cut. The director slapped the girl again, the lash striking across her brow this time. The other witches pulled back, faces white in terror at the sight.

Katyusha barely saw it, every sound was muted, echoing distantly in her ears, and her vision swayed, unsteady. Still, she rushed forwards to Minori's body as the child witch behind her let go, the young girl covering her mouth and whimpering at the sight of the Director striking her sister.

"Healinghealinghealinghealing-" gasped Katyusha, laying her hands on Minori's body. Her magic rushed forwards into Minori's head.

Delve.

Minimal puncture in upper skull. Brain damage severe, entry wound in parietal lobe, damage to cerebrum, temporal lobe completely disrupted, optic nerves destroyed, metal shards embedded within cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Occipital bone at base of skull shattered outwards into mouth and Nasal cavities. Internal carotid artery, internal thyroid vein… blood vessels in the neck a mess. Exit wounds at base of neck. Severe blood loss. Severe neck muscle lacerations.

Katyusha swallowed, trying to regulate her breathing. Brain injuries of this magnitude…

Nonono.

No time.

Her magic surged forth, a volume that she had never before managed in life.

Brain matter recreated, bones fused, blood vessels sealing, all at a speed she had never managed herself or seen any other med witch achieve.

"I can do it. This injury is nothing. I can do it. This injury is nothing. I can do it. This injury is nothing, I can bring back even the dead." whispered Katyusha as she worked frantically.

In the background, she saw the blood spilled from Minori glowing and rising back into her body. It would be needed. She co-opted the Magic that still remained in Minori's body, drawing it out, using it to accelerate the healing.

Torn flesh reshaped itself. The blood vessels reformed. The metals fragments changed in their atomic structure, becoming elements needed for organic proteins. Bones reformed, pieces of a jigsaw sliding back together. Simple nerves reconnected. The brain-

The brain-

What do I do?

The brain started-

Reform?

The intact sections of the brain clumped together, neurons embracing familiar neurons as easily as any other healing-

Now? Recreate?

In the emptiness where the cells had simply been mulched by the magic enhanced bullet, the retrieved organic soup formed neurons connecting to each other-

But if I recreate it

The cells shifted, breaking down-

Will it actually be her?

The neurons again formed, forming the brain of Kunato Minori, exactly as Katyusha wanted her to be-

No. I can't.

Regrow.

Please work.

Please.

You tried, thank you. Please don't feel guilty.

Katyusha snapped her eyes open, next to her Kunato Minori also opened her eyes, brown eyes locking on Katyusha's face before taking in their surroundings. Standing up, Minori stood up with her, still scanning their surroundings.

[SIS 15R Open Channel]
Holy shit. Holy shit. She did it.
No. She didn't. Poor girl.​

"Minori?" Katyusha beamed, all other problems forgotten for the moment. She had done it. She had overcome death.

The Director slowly approached from the side, the bleeding from his hand stemmed, "I don't believe it. Kunato Minori. Are you well?"

"Weeeeeeeeeell?" Minori glanced at him, drawing out the word, looking curious.

"Um, Minori?" Katyusha asked, worry shattering her euphoric mood.

Minori met her glare, expression severe.

"Miinoori?!" the other girl beamed, ending her own name on a high note, skipping slightly.

"…What did you do?" the Director demanded softly.

Minori's hands slipped from Katyusha's numb grip, "I…"

Minori giggled, "Waaatashiwaah! Waaagahwaa!"

"You destroyed her mind! Fix her!" demanded the Director.

Katyusha was already stepping forward. She grabbed Minori's body and delved.

Nothing was wrong, the brain was working normally.

No, perhaps that wasn't what was needed. She still remembered the sensation of when they had touched their heads against each other. The feeling of infinity. She remembered Minori. Who she was. Her life. Her dreams. She wouldn't have wanted this.

She could write those into the brain. It would be the same person. Wouldn't it? Katyusha gathered magic, pushing it forwards into Minori's body. Into her mind. It was only a few small changes.

Her magic flowed forth… and failed, withdrawing back into her body. Why didn't it work? She tried again, pushing forwards with her magic, finding the neurons. Just change them up a little, it wasn't even changing, she was putting them back where they really belonged- Her magic was slower this time, less… and failed the same, withdrawing back into herself rapidly.

Katyusha strained, trying to heal, to bring back Minori. Each time, there was less and less magic. Each time, what was in her grasp slipped away faster.

As she struggled with her magic, something inside her snapped.

Leaning back, Katyusha blinked. The world was blurrier, duller, quieter.

She stared down at her hands. Blurry, indistinct, her vision was… normal, "No… my magic…"

"What happened?" the Director asked from behind her.

"My magic, it's…"

A moment of strained silence.

"Give it some encouragement Ichi."

For a brief moment, there was the sensation of a nothing but a hard impact accompanied by the sound of a gunshot. Then, a flash of red hot pain ran through her side. Katyusha slumped to the ground, gasping.

It hurt. It hurt so terribly.

The bullet wound burned.

"No signs of enhanced healing. Again Nii. Somewhere painful."

The other girl raised her pistol.

Katyusha raised her hand, weakly shielding herself, "No, wait-"

Katyusha's ankle exploded into red gore. She writhed on the floor, vision blacking out and fading back in, lacking the air to scream.

"No signs of abnormal recovery. It appears it has lost its magic."

"Ah… Ka… Kahu… Kahuha!" for a moment, Katyusha's vision cleared. Minori's body was leaning over her, face concerned.

"Heh- Hal- Heal?" Minori laid a hand on Katyusha. Katyusha felt a moment of hope.

It was dashed when Minori leaned back, expression once again one of ignorant unconcern, Katyusha didn't feel any changes to her own injuries.

"…From that reaction, there is hope still. San, give it a once over and make sure it doesn't die. Yon, take them to the chambers. Nii, call control, one of our witches in the Western theatre regained her magic correct? Have them recall her. No, that's far too slow, especially with the front as it is…"

The director paced for a moment, "Ichi, Roku, take Nana to the chambers as well. She will be the first test subject for methods of artificially inducing magic loss and artificially regaining magic."

"NOOO! Daddy! Daddy please! Don't make me! Daddy-!"

"Ichi, shut that thing up."

"Yes daddy!" a slight scuffle.

"Move out girls. We've got major work to do. We're so close. We must not fail."

"You men, sweep the city. Co-ordinate with the nationalists, I don't want a single stone left unturned. Find those files…"

The pain in her side and ankle spiked and for a moment Katyusha thought that she was going to die from agony alone. She vaguely recognised it as a very basic healing in a distant corner of her mind. It faded as fast as it appeared, leaving her woozy.

A hand grabbed Katyusha by the hair and wrenched her along the ground roughly, provoking her destroyed ankle further. There was a tearing sensation as she was lifted bodily by her hair and thrown onto a metal floor. Minori's body was hustled in next to her. Steel doors crashed closed, cutting out the light.

The sound of an engine accompanied her as she fell unconscious.

XxXxXxXxXx

"Liu Xin! Do we go in? We can divert one car, our people are in place!"

"…I promised Minori that I would consider it… I have considered it."

"You can't be serious-"

"Lu Qin! Do you really think we can smuggle a girl with those injuries out right now? With the nationalists locking down the docks and those- those Fusoan soldiers still up there?!"

"…You're not who I thought you were."

"…"

XxXxXxXxXx

…Jans. We take them apart.
Aye. We will help the communists spread the word. Then we come back.
They hang, each and every. To the last. I will knot the noose myself.

###Author's note

Heya guys, this is an Omake I've been working on for a while,: I had an idea for an omake on the raid on Unit 731. It got somewhat out of hand.

This is part one of two btw, finishing editing the second half right now.

It's kinda long, sorta edging into full blown fanfiction here. Daily life of med witches?

This is non canon since it contradicts that other Omake about the Brit specops in particular and other stuff such as the sequence of events in general, but eh, I had fun.

Umm, yeah, I'm not really a fast writer and the threads moved fast. I was hoping to surprise everybody by reminding the thread that we have supressors and lightning guns but chriswriter had to bring up both several times. Hell, he even talked about James Bond! Then Jwolf talked about language difficulties in his snip. I swear that people are reading my mind. Slow writing gonna be slow and pre-empted.
I mean seriously, my everything was preempted by Chimera writing turn 14. *Shakes fist*


Man, there is sure a lot of stuff to keep in mind when writing in the SW universe. Harbin for example would not have a huge ethnic Russian population since the White Russians never lost to the Red Russians, the Japanese wouldn't be pulling shit all over Manchuria since they haven't invaded China (probably), Communists would probably be pressed into the North East areas of China rather than the mid East by the Nationalists due to the fact that it's a Neuroi hive all the way in Vladisvostok that they're fighting rather than the Japanese, European colonialism probably spread to the extent it probably did in IRL then got hammered by the Neuroi beating up Europe, twice at that, Japan is East Asia Megapower ala modern China, and everybody in East Asia still hates each other since My grandad died cause your grandad and all that. Lot's of butterflies, but this ain't Alt History, so they're gonna be handwaved.

Ugh, I have no idea where the centers of communist control would be so Imma just gonna say they're in the north west, since those areas are always the poorer regions of china where a plebian movement such as communism could start off and maintain itself. Coastal regions likely don't work since established middle class are practically anathema to communism. Of course, depending on how oppression the Nationalists go, this might not be valid. Then again, without Zhong Guo losing the Sino-Japanese war to spark the 1911 revolution to overthrow the Qing dynasty there shouldn't be a nationalist party, and without Bloody Sunday up in Russia there shouldn't be Communists either. Lol whatever. Roll with it I guess.

Honestly, the hardest part of the this snip was finding a legitimate Russian city for where Vlad was up to around turn 7. Eastern Siberia is freaking ass empty. Seriously. There are more Russians in China in Harbin then there were in Sakhalinsk or Blagochevnsk in 1935, which are like the two largest cities combined after Vladivostok in Eastern Siberia.
